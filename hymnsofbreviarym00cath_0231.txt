It will be observed that with a few noteworthy ex-
ceptione the hymns in honor of the Saints have not been
translated as often as the remaining hymns of the Breviary.

Saint is more or less national in oharaoter, and the Breviary
contains few hymns in honor of Saints who are especially
venerated in English-speaking eountries.
