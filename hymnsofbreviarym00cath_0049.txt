SUNDAY AT MATINS

⁸Ne foeda sit, vel lubrica That this our body’s mortal frame
Compago nostri corporis, May know no sin, and sear no
Ob cujus ignes ignibus shame,
Avernus urat acrius. Nor fire hereafter be the end
Of passions which our bosoms
rend.
⁷Mundi Redemptor, quaesumuS, Redeemer of the world, we pray
Tu probra nostra diluas: Tha t Tho ou woulds t wash our sins
Nobisque largus commoda away,
Vitae perennis conferas. And give us, of Thy boundles ss
grace,
The bless mgs of the heavenly

⁸Praesta, Pater piissime, Most Holy Father‚ hear our cry
Patrique compar Unice, Thr ough Jesus Chris t our Lord
Cum Spiritu Paraclito most Hig h
Regnans per omne saeculum. Who, with theg Holy Ghost and

Shall 13⁷1?an reign eternally.
