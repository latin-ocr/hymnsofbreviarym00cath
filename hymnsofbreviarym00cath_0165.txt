Et Filio, qui a mortuis From death arisen, praise be
Surrexit, ac Paraclsto, done:
In sempiterna saecula. With God the Holy Ghost on high

Henceforth to all eternity.

This is a continuation of the two preceding hymnS.
TRANSLATION by Alan G. MoDougall. LITURGICAL Usa:
Hymn for Lauds in the Common Offiee of Apostles and
Evangelists in Eastertide.

1. “A more beauteous sun proelaims to the world the
joys of Easter, when the Apostles behold J esus resplendent
with a new light. ' ' The “new light'⁷ is that which emanates
from His glorified body. The sun is now “more beauteous’'
for at His death it was darkened.

2. “They wonder to see the wounds in the flesh of
Christ shine like stars, and what they see, as faithful wit-
nesses, they proelaim.'' Vulnera.- That the marks of the
nails and spear were plainly visible in the glorified body of
Christ is evident from the testimony of St. Thomas (ef.
John 20, 27-28).

3. “O Christ, King most meroiful, possess Thou our
hearts, that our tongues may return due thanks to Thy
Name.''

4. “That Thou, O Jews, mayest be the everlasting
Paschal joy of our hearts, deliver us re-born to life, from a
dire death of sin.’'

65 Salutis humanae Sator
ALUTIS humanae Sator, AIL, Thou who man’s Re-
Jesu, voluptas cordium, deemer art,
Orbis redempti Conditor, Jesu, the joy of every heart3
Et casta lux amantium: Great Maker of the world’s wide
And Ρὶιξὲἕειξ, love’s delight and
flame:
²Qua victus es clementia, What nameless mercy Thee o’er-
Ut nostra ferres crimina? came,
To bear our load of sin and
shame?
