THE PSALTER

‘Speculator adstat desuper, Views in His revealing ray
Qui nos diebus omnibus, All we do, and think, and say,
Actusque nostros prospicit Watching us from break of day
A luce prima in vesperum. Till the twilight fall.

⁵Deo Patri sit gloria, Unto God the F ather, Son,
Eiusque soli Filio, Holy Spirit, Three in One,
Cum Spiritu Paraclsto, One in Three, be glory done,

Nunc et per omne saeculum. Now and evermore.

Amnon: Prudentius (348-413). METER: Iambie dimeter.
TRANSLATION by W, J. Gourthope. There are seventeen
translations. This hymn is a cento from the M orniny H ymn
of the Cathemerinon of Prudentius. See the note on this
hymn and its translation, under Ales diez· nuntius, hymn 14.

1. “Behold, the golden light arises; may the waning
darkness, which long drew us headlong in wide-wandering
error, depart.’' In praeceps, headlong3 into great danger.
It should be borne in mind that this is a hymn for Laude,
and that Lauds was said at daybreak. As the rising sun
dispels the blinding darkness, so Christ, the Sun of Justioe
(Mal. 4, 2), dispels the darkness of sin and of unbelief.

2. “May this light bring us contentment, and may it pre-
serve us pure for itself3 may we speak nothing deeeitfu13
may we meditate nothing dark.'' Sibi refers to lux (i.e.,
Christus).

3. “So may the whole day run its course3 that neither
the tongue prone to lie, nor the hands, nor the restless eyes
sin3 may no sin defile the body.’'

4. “An Observer stands on high, who each day beholds
us and our actions, from early morning until evening.''
