DIES IRAE

870

ΑΗ that day of wrath and woe,

When the fire that seers foreknow
All the world shall overflow.

—Canon Brtghc

Dies irae, dies izm: These words of “startling suddenness''
with which the poet ushers in his theme are from the
Prophet Sophonias: Dies irae, dies illa, dies tribulationis et
angustiae, dies calamitatis et miseriae, dies tenebrarum et
caliginis, dies nebulae et turbinis, dies tubae et clangoris
(Soph. 1, 15-16). Solvet.- (cf. II Peter 3, 10). Teste David.-
(cf. Pss. 10, 73 49, 3-6; and esp. 101, 26-28). Sibylla.- If any
particular Sibyl is meant it is the Erythraean Sibyl, the
author of the well-known acrostic on the name of Christ.
However, “David and the Sibyl'’ here stand for Jew and
Gentile, the witnesses respectively of inspiration and of
mere natural religion. See the article on Sibyllina Ονασῑεε,
in the cath. Encycl.

2. “How great shall be the trembling, when the Judge
shall come to investigate rigidly all things.'’

Ο what trembling shall appear

When His coming shall he near

Who shall all things strictly clear.
——Dean Alford

For the Scriptural account of the J udge's coming to judge
the world, cf. Luke 21, 25-27. Stricte discussurus: Το
search and thoroughly lay bare.

3. “The trumphet scattering a wondrous sound through
the sepulchers of the whole world shall gather all before
the throne.'’

At the unearthly trump’s command

Heard in graves of every land

All before the throne must stand.
—Canon Bright

Tuba: Et mittet angelos suos cum tuba et Voce magna: et
congregabunt „Temo-s ejus a quattuor ventis, a summis
coelorum usque ad terminos eorum (Matt. 24, 31).
