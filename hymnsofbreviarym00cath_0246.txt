98 Te dicimus praeconio

TE dicimus praeconio,
Intacta Mater Numinis,
Nostris benigna laudibus
Tuam repende gratiam.

²Sontes Adami posteri
Infecta proles gignimur3
Labis paternae nescia
Tu sola, Virgo, crederis.

³Caput draconis invidi
Tu conteris vestigio,
Et sola gloriam refers
Intaminatae originis.

¹0 gentis humanae decus

Quae tollis Hevae opprobrium,

Tu nos tuere supplices,
Tu nos labantes erige.

VIRGIN Mother of our God,

While we thy matchless
glories ebant,
Do thou, in answer to our praise,
To us abundant graces grant.

We Adam’s guilty children are,
A sin-infected progeny,

Thou art, Ο Virgin, we believe,
Alone from his infection free.

The envious dragon’s cruel head
Thou with thy heel dost trample
And ofdgvffginless origin

Thou only dost the glory own.

O F lower of the human race,

Who takest Eve’s reproach away,

Protect us when we cry to thee,

Our tottering footsteps deign to
stay.
