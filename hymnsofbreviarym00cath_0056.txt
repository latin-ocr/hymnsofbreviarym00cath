THE PSALTER

20. Redemisti: (of. I Peter 1, 18-19) Verses 22-23 are
taken verbatim from Psalm 27, 9.

22. H oereditati tuce: Thine own3 those whom Thou ha-st re-
deemed.

24. Per singulos dies.- every day3 from Psalm 144, 2.

27. Miserere: verbatim from Psalm 122, 3.

28. Fiat.- verbatim from Psalm 32, 22.

29. In te.- verbatim from Psalm 30, 2.

The following translation preserves much of the spirit
and force of the original. The seventh stanza is a render-
ing of verses 20-21 by Monsignor Henry. The remaining
stanzas are by Father Walworth, whose translation does
not oontain a rendering of verses 20-21. The numbers pre-
ceding a stanza refer to the verses of the Te Deum rendered
in that stanza.

Holy God‚ we praise Thy Name,
Lord of all, we bow before Thee;
All on earth Thy scepter claim,
All in heaven above adore Thee;

Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.

Hark‚ the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising3
Cherubim and Seraphim

In unceasing chorus praising,

F ill the heavens with sweet accord3

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!

, 7-10

Lo, the Apostolic train
Join‚ Thy sacred Name to hallow:

Prophets swell the loud refrain,
And the white-robed Martyrs follow;

And, from morn till set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.

11-13

Holy Father‚ Holy Son,
Holy Spirst, Three we name Thee,
While in Essence only One,
