AUTHORS OF THE HYMNS

fifth or sixth century, are styled Ambrosiani—Ambrosian
hymns. They are so styled either because they were
formerly supposed to have been written by St. Ambrose,
or because they imitate the stanzaic form, the style, meter,
and austere objectiveness of the genuine hymns of the
Saint. It is now known for certain that many hymns
formerly thought to be his are the compositions of unknown
writers. These hymns are uniformly written in Iambic
dimeter. The term Ambrosian implies no ascription of
authorship, but merely a poetical form. Hymns: 1, 5, 20,
21, 22, 29, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 69,
71, 155, 157, 161, 162.

ANTONIANO, OARDINAL SILVIO (1540-1603) was
educated at the University of Ferrara, in which institution
he later became professor of classical literature. He is
best known as a student of educational problems. Hymn:

BELLARMINE, CARDINAL (1542-1621) was a dis-
tinguished ὲ1051111 theologian and controversialist. He
was born at Montepulciano in Italy. He became Arch-
bishop of Capua but resigned that see to accept the office
of librarian of the Vatican. He was proclaimed Venerable
by Pope Urban VIII, in 1627. Hymns: 125, 136, 137.

BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX, ST. (1091-1153) was born
near Dijon in France. Abbot and Doctor of the Ohurch—
surnamed the “Mellifiuous Doctor.'’ There is much doubt
as to the authorship of the hymns usually ascribed to St.
Bernard. Even his claim to the celebrated hymn, Jesu
dulcis memoria has been called in question. Dom Pothier
found it in a MS. of the 11th century, in which it is ascribed
to 3 Benedictine Abbess. During his lifetime‚ St. Bernard
exercised an extraordinary influence both by his eloquence
and by his writings. Hymns: 43, 44, 45, 130.

BERNARD OF CLUNY (or of Morlaix) was born at
Morlaix in Brittany early in the 12th century. He entered
the celebrated Benedictine Abbey of Cluny where he re—
mained until 1115 death, the date of which is unknown. He
is the author of one of the most famous poems of the
Middle Ages, the De contemptu mundi, which contains
about 3,000 lines in dactylic hexameters. It is dedicated
