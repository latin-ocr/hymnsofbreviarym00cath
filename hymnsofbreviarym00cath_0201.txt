CORPUS CHRISTI

Per tuas semitas duc nos quo As we our homage pay3
tendimus, And in Thy footsteps bright
Ad lucem, quam inhabitas. Conduct us on our way
To where Thou dwell’st in cloud-
less light.

See “Preliminary Observations'' above, METER: As-
clepiadic and Glyconic. TRANSLATION, a cento based on the
translation by J. D. Ohambers. There are about fifteen
translations, two of which are in the Annus Sanctus.
LITURGICAL Usn: Matins hymn for the Feast of Corpus
Christi. The meter imitates the Classical meter of Horace,
but like all the hymns of St. Thomas, it is purely accentual.
On account of the rhyme‚ the Asclepiadic lines may be
conveniently divided at the caesura..

1. “With this sacred solemnity let our joys be blended,
and from our inmost heart let praises resound3 let old
things depart, let all be new—hearts, wordS‚ and works.''
Vetera: the olden rites‚ the Pasch and its attendant cere-
monies; or, sin, sinful habits, the leaven of malice and
wickedness (I Cor. 5, 7-8). N ova.- let all things be new, or
renewed by the grace of God.

2. “Of that night, the Last Supper is recalled to mind,
at which we believe that Christ gave the lamb and the
leavenless bread to His brethren, according to the legal
precepts given to the ancient fathers.'' (οἳ. Exod. 12-13.)

3. “After the typic lamb, and when the meal was ended,
we profess that Our Lord, with His own hands, gave His
Body to His brethren; He so gave It that the whole was
given to all, and the whole to each.'' Totum (sc. corpus).

4. “He gave to the weak His Body as food, and He gave
to the sad the cup of His Blood‚ saying: Receive ye the
cup which I give to you, drink ye all of it.''

5. “Thus He instituted this Sacrifice (Sacrament) the
administration of which He willed should be entrusted to
priests alone, whom it thus behooves to receive it them-
selves, and to give it to others.''

6. “The Bread of Angels becomes the Bread of men3
the Bread of Heaven puts an end to types3 Ο wondrous
thing, the poor, the servant, and the lowly, eat their Lord!’'
