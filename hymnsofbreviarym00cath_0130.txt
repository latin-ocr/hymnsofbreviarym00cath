PROPER OF THE SEASON

four times.'' More mystico, sacred tradition. The Lenten
fast is of very ancient, if not of apostolic origin. A similar
fast was observed by the prophets Moses (Ex. 34, 28) and
Elias (ΙΙΙ Kings 19, 7-8). Demo, see denus in the Glossary.
Some texts have denum (= denorum). The following is
Ν eale's translation of this stanza rewritten in Hymns
Anoieozt and M odem.-

By precepts taught of ages past,
Now let us keep again the fast

Which, year by year, in order meet
Of forty days is made complete.

2. “The law and the prophets first revealed this; after-
wards Christ, the king and maker of all seasons‚ sanctified
it.” Hoc, sc. jejunium, the Lenten fast. Lex et prophetae:
By the law is meant the Mosaic Law, the Pentateuch3 by
the propheta, the later books of the Old Testament. Lex
et prophetae usque ad J oannem (Luke 16, 16).

3. “Let us, therefore, use more sparingly words, food,
and drink, sleep and jests, and let us remain severely stead-
fast on our guard.’'

4. “Moreover, let us avoid those hurtful things which
subvert fickle souls3 and let us give no occasion for the
tyranny of the cunning foe.’'

5-6. “May we, weeping before the Judge, soften His
avenging wrath3 let us cry aloud With suppliant voices, and
prostrate let us all say: ‘By our sins, Ο God, we have
offended Thy goodness; pour out upon us from on high,
O forgiver of sins, Thy mercy.' ''

7. “Remember that we are Thy creatures (tui plasmatis)
though frai13 we beseech Thee that Thou give not to an-
other the honor of Thy Name.'' Plasmatis, the genitive
denoting possession with 63335 of Thy making, creation.
Alteri, to Satan, the enemy of the human race.

8. “Pardon the evil we have done; increase the good for
which we pray, that we may at length be able to please

Thee here and in eternity.''
