PROPER OF SAINTS

’En vocat septem famulos, fideles
Ut sibi in luctu recolant dolores,
Quos tulit Jesus, tulit ipsa

consors
Sub cruce Nati.

³Illico parent Dominae vocanti:
splendidis tectis opibusque
spretis,
Urbe secedunt procul in Senari
Abdita montis.

⁴Corpora hic poenis cruciant
acerbis,
Sontium labes hominum piantes:
Hic prece avertunt lacrymisque
fusis
Numinis iram.

⁵Perdolens Mater fovet, atque
amictum
Ipsa lugubrem monet induendum:
Agminis sancti pia coepta
surgunt,
Mira patescunt.

⁶Palmes in bruma viridans
honores
Nuntiat patrum: proprios Mariae
- Ore lactenti vocitant puelli
Nomine Servos.

'Sit decus Patri, genitaeque Proli,
Et tibi, compar utriusque virtus
Spiritus semper, Deus unus,

omni
Temporis aevo.

Ammon: Vincent Tarozzi‚ 19th cent.

Seven faithful sons she bid to
Her Βξῖιεῗιξξε, all the shame and
OSS

Which J esus suffered, and she bare
Beneath His Cross.

So when their Lady called, as

naught

They deemed their palaces and
weahh,

The mountain’s desert places
sought

Far off by stealth.

For others' sins the scourge they
As theyplffg'way of penance trod;
By Ρῐειζξίῐὲθειηά tears they turned

The wrath of God.
Token of love, the Mother’s hand

Gave to her sons their garb of
Sanctiohvdg’the pious work they
planned,
With wondrous show.

The vine, to spread their honors

wide,

Her sprouts in winter greenly
flung,

“See, thosed are Mary's servants‚”
crie

The infant tongue.

Now to the Father thanks and
To Τὴεὲῑῧεὸῗη, the same we send3
To Τὴεὲᾏέἔεειῐ Spirit‚ through all

World without end.
