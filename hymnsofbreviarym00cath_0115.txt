COME, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
Ο hasten, Ο hasten to Bethlehem
See in a manger
The Monarch of Angels.

O come let us worship
Christ the Lord.

God of God eternal‚
Light from Light proceeding‚
He deigns in the Virgin's womb
to lie;
Very God of very God,
Begotten, not created.
O come, etc.

Sing alleluia,
All ye choirs of Angels;
sing, all ye citizens of heaven
above,
Glory to God
In the highest.
Ο come, etc.

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning3

To Thee, Ο J esus, be glory given;
True Word of the F ather,
In our flesh appearing.
O come let us worship

Christ the Lord.

hymn. The Adeste Fideles is not found in the Breviary or

come to Bethlehem’' in spirit, and worship the new-born

Saviour.
