This is a continuation of the preceding hymn. TRANS-
LATION by Father Oaswall. LITURGICAL Usu: Hymn for
Lauds on the Feast of the Dedication of a Church.

1. “From the highest heights of heaven came the sov-
ereign Father's Son, like the stone riven from the mountain
descending to the lowest plains, and He joined together the
two corners of the earthly and heavenly dwelling places.''
Venit is understood in the first two lines. Christ is the
stone that came down from on high. He is also the corner-
stone that makes both one, «Jews and Gentiles, or the
heavenly and the earthly kingdom (Of. I Pet. 2, 6; Eph.
2, 20). The figure of the stone riven from the mountain
is probably an allusion to the dream of Nabuchodonosor
(Of. Dan. 2, esp. 34-45).

2. “But that abode of the Blessed ever resounds with
praises‚ and extols with ceaseless song the Triune God3 to
it we rivals of holy Sion are joined in song.'' Illi, sc. sedes
Coelitum. Juyz', adj„ perpetual. Sion ordinarily stands
for the Church Militant; it is here used for the Church
Triumphant.

3. “These temples‚ O king of the Blessed, fill with Thy
kindly light; hither, come Thou when invoked‚ and receive
the prayers of Thy people‚ and fill our hearts forever with
the grace of Heaven.''

4. “Here may the voices of the faithful and the prayers
of Thy suppliants obtain the rewards of the heavenly
home3 and may they enjoy the gifts acquired‚ till, freed
from the body, they take possession of the blessed abodes.''
