AUTHORS OF THE HYMNS

Aquino, a town near Naples. He entered the Dominican
Order and became one of the greatest doctors of the
Church. He is by common consent, “The Poet of the Most
Holy Sacrament of the Altar.” He oomposed the Mass and
Office of the Feast of Corpus Christi and five sublime
hymns in honor of the Blessed Sacrament. Hymns: 75,
76, 77, 78, 79.

THOMAs OF CELANO was born at Celano in Italy
about 1200, and died about 1255. He was one of the first
disciples of St. Francis Assisi. On the death of St. Francis,
Thomas, at the request of Pope Gregory IX, wrote his
life. He also wrote two beautiful sequences in honor of
St. Francis. His immortality as a poet is based on his
very probable authorship of the greatest of all hymns, the
Dies I roe. Hymn: 87.

URBAN VIII, POPE (1568-1644) was born at Florence‚
and was educated at the Collegio Romano. He graduated
from the University of Padua as Doctor of Laws. He is
commonly recognized as a generous patron of learning, and
was himself a man of letters, and an elegant writer and
poet. It is not unnatural that a man of his taste and
culture should have become imbued with the Humanistic
spirit of the age in which he lived. It was under his direc-
tions that the hymns of the Roman Breviary were revised
by a committee of four distinguished Jesuit scholars. The
revised hymns were published in 1632, and are still found
in the Roman Breviary. Hymns: 92, 93, 94, 107, 108, 123,
124, 142, 143.

WIPO was a native of Burgundy, and flourished during
the first half of the eleventh century. He was a secular
priest, and was for some time chaplain to the Emperors
Conrad* II, and Henry III, to each of whom he presented a
collection of poems. Hymn: 59.

XAVIER, ST. FRANOIS (1506-1552), the Apostle of
India and Japan, was born near Sanguesa in Spain. He
studied at the University of Paris, and was one of the first
associates of St. Ignatius of Loyola when the latter
founded the Society of Jesus. Shortly after his ordination
he began his wonderful missionary career which ended only
with his death. Hymn: 74.
