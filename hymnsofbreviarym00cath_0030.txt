INTRODUCTION

lyric meters‚ is most suitable for congregational singing
and is easily memorized. The hymns of St. Ambrose be-
came very popular, and from Milan they spread rapidly
throughout the West. Many imitators arose who imitated
the style and meter of St. Ambrose. All such hymns were
given the general name Ambrosz'ani—Ambrosian hymns. So
popular were the hymns of St. Ambrose and of the Am-
brosian school of hymn-writers that with a few insignifi-
cant exceptions hymns in this meter were almost exclusively
used down to the eleventh century, nor did other meters
come into extensive use until as late as the sixteenth cen-
tury. Even to this day hymns written by st. Ambrose or
by his imitators greatly predominate in the Breviary. H. A.
Daniel in his Thesaurus Hynznoloyicus (Vol. 1), gives
ninety-two hymns which he ascribes to St. Ambrose or to
his contemporaries or successors. Many of these Ambros-
iani are certainly not the work of St. Ambrose. The Bene-
dictine editors of the works of St. Ambrose attribute to him
twelve hymns. Father Dreves‚ the eminent hymnologist,
after a careful study of the hymnaries in the Vatican and
at Milan in 1893, gives it as his opinion that fourteen of
the hymns ascribed to St. Ambrose are ‘⁴ genuine’' and that
four others are “possibly his.''

During the four centuries that elapsed between the death
of St. Ambrose (397) and that of Charlemagne (814), many
Christian poets sang in noble strains. In meter and out-
ward form they imitated the hymns of St. Ambrose. Con-
spicuous among those whose hymns are used in the Divine
Office are the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) whose
Cathemerinon is frequently mentioned in this volume;
Sedulius (5th cent.) who gave us the beautiful Christmas
hymn A solis ortus cardine; Fortunatus (d. 609) “the last
of the Latin poets of Gaul’' and the author of the incom-
parable Vemilla Reyis and of the sublime passion hymn
Panye linyuffl St. Gregory the Great (d. 604) to whom tra-
dition assigns a. place among the hymn-writers3 Paul the
Deacon (d. 799), a Benedictine of Monte Cassino‚ the author
of the first Sapphic hymn Ut queant laxis; and Rabanus
Maurus (d. 856), the learned Archbishop of Mainz‚ the
probable author of the Vem· Creator Spiritus,
