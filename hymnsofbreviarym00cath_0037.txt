Scale ⁴⁴5⁹· Trocnaic Dimeter Brachycatalectlc

Ave maris stella, Ave, Star of ocean,

Dei Mater Alma, Child Divine who barest‚
Atque semper Virgo, Mother‚ Ever·Virgin,
Felix coeli porta. Heaven’s portal fairest.

In this hymn (alone) each line consists of three troebees,
“Brachyeataleetie‚’' i.e.‚ wanting two syllables or the last
foot of the final dipody. See hymn 149 and. its two transla-

Pange, lingua, gloriosi lauream certaminis,
Et super crucis trophaeo dic triumphum nobilem,
Qualiter Redemptor orbis immolatus vicerit.

Sing‚ my tongue‚ the glorious battle, sing the ending of the fray;
Now above the Cross, the trophy‚ sound the loud triumphant lay:
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer‚ as a Victim won the day.

The caesura uniformly follows the fourth foot—thus di-
viding each verse into a trochaio dimeter aaataleetio, and a

trochaie dimeter catalecti03 thus,
Pange lingua gloriosi Sing‚ my tongue, the glo-riona

Lauream certaminis, etc. battle,
Sing the ending of the stay, etc.

In the Breviary the lines are uniformly broken in two
at the caesura, thus forming stanzas of six lines. See hymns
52, 53, 76, 119, 132, 134Β, 168 and their English translations.
