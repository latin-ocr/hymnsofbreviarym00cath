man is one Christ'' (From the Creed of St. Athanasius).
Such was the Christ who was born for us at Bethlehem3
the Good Shepherd who sought out the lost sheep of the
house of Israe13 the great High Priest who gave Himself
to His disciples with His own hands at the Last Supper3
and who as Priest and Victim offered Himself on Calvary,
and daily offers Himself on countless altars from the rising
till the setting of the sun.

6. “Christ is entirely present under each species and
under each particle of either species. Christ is entirely
present—with His flesh and blood, His body and soul, His

and gave to them, saying: This is my body which is given
for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. In like
manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This
is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall
be shed for you.'' See also the words of promise (St.
John 6, 48-59) which were uttered by Our Lord about one

sacrifices it prescribed were but the types or shadows, not
