fully capable of giving expression to the most subtle and
refined thoughts and feelings of the human soul.

Fortunately also men gloried in their Faith and in the
external manifestation of it in literature, in architecture, in
painting, and in sculpture. Unfortunately these conditions
obtain no longer. Latin has become a dead language even
to scholars, and. no one writes poetry in a language which
110 1133 1101 learned from his mother but from books. The
second cause of the decay of hymnody was the Renaissance.
To the Humanist no Latin poem was correct that did not
measure up 10 1110 classical standards of the Augustan Age.
Any deviation from this stan-dard was a barbarism. “The
Humanists,’' says Father Clemens Blume, S.J., “abomi-
nated the rhythmica] poetry of the Middle Ages from an
exaggerated enthusiasm for ancient Classical forms and
meters. Hymnody then received its death blow as, on the
revision of the Breviary under Pope Urban VIII, the
medieval rhythmica] hymns were forced into more classical
forms by means of so-called corrections.'' (cath. Eneycl„
Art. Hymnody). Pope Urban was himself a Humanist,
the last in fact of the Humanist Popes. During his reign a
commission was appointed to revise the Breviary, and 3
special commission of four distinguished J esuit schol-ars,
Fathers Sarbiewski, Strada, Galluzzi, and Petrucci was ap-
pointed to correct the hymns of the Breviary. As 3 result
of the labors of this commission, 952 corrections were made
in the 98 hymns then in the Breviary. Eighty-one hymns
were corrected: 58 alterations were made in the hymns of
the Psalter‚ 359 in the Proper of the 8033011, 283 111 1110
Proper of the 8311113, and 252 in the Common of the Saints.
The first lines of more than 30 hymns were altered.

The Jam lucis orto sidere, the Ave Maris Stella, the
hymns of 81. Thomas Aquinas, and a few others were
spared. Some hymns were practically rewritten, others
were scarcely touched. In 1629, the Sacred Gongregation
of Rites approved of the alterations, and by the Bull
Divinam Psalmodiam in 1632, Pope Urban VIII introduced
them into the official edition of the Breviary. In connection
with the revision of the hymns it should be borne in mind
that the act of Urban VIII was 3 purely disciplinary act,
