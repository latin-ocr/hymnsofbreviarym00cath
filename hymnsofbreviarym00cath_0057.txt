SUNDAY AT LAUDS

Undivided God we claim Thee:
And, adoring‚ bend the knee
While we own the mystery.

14-17

Thou art King of glory, Christ;

Son of God, yet born of Mary;

For us sinners sacrifieed‚

And to death a tributary:

First to break the bars of death,

Thou hast opened heaven to saith.

18-19

From Thy high celestial home,
Judge of all, again returning‚
We believe that Thou shalt come

In the dreadful Doomsday morning;
When Thy voice shall shake the earth,

And the startled dead come forth.

20-21

Therefore do we pray Thee, Lord:

Help Thy servants whom, redeeming
By Thy Precious Blood outpoured‚
Thou hast saved from Satan’s scheming.
Give to them eternal rest

In the glory of the Blest.

22, 26, 29

Spare Thy people, Lord, we pray,
By a thousand snares surrounded:
Keep us without sin to-day‚

Never let us be confounded.

Lo, I put my trust in Thee;

Never, Lord, abandon me.
