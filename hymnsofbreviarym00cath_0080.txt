THE PSALTER

Cum luce nobis effluat, Ο may it to Thy minstrels prove
Hoc dum canore concrepat. The dawning of a better day.
⁴Deo Patri sit gloria, To God the F ather glory be,
Ejusque soli Filio, And to His sole-begotten Son:
Cum Spiritu Paraclito, Glory, Ο Holy Ghost, to Thee‚
Nunc et per omne saeculum. While everlasting ages run,

AUTHOR: Ambrosiam 4'th or 5th cent. METER: lambio
dimeter. TRANSLATION by Father Caswall. There are twelve
translations.

1. “The dawn now overspreads the heavens; day glides
over the earth3 rays of light mount on high3 may every un-
clean thing depart.''

2. “Let phantoms of the night be banished; let guiltof
50111 depart3 whatever dreadful thing of evil the night
brought With it, let it vanish with the darkness.'' Constr.:
Quidquid horridum culpae nox attulit, tenebris cadat.

3. “That on the last morning, together with the light,
that which we here humbly pray for, and what accords with
our song, may issue forth (come) to us.’' Oonstr.: Ut 011111
11100 (aeterna) mane (illud) ultimum nobis effluat, quod 1105
1110, (111111 hoc canore concrepat, deprecamur cernui. This
stanza is very obscure. It seems to contain a reference to
the present morning, and to the last morning—at the end
of time. In this sense it might be rendered: “While the
present morning resounds with song (canore), we here with
profound humility beg (deprecamur cernui) that the last
morning may also dawn (effluat) for us With light eternal.''
Abp. Bagshawe translates mane ultimum as referring to
Saturday—“On this morn of the week the last.'‘ The fol-

aexssndg 15 from an anonymous translation in the Hymnal
ο e .·

So that last morning, dread and great,
Which we with trembling hope await‚
With blessed light for us shall glow,

Who chant the song we sang below.
