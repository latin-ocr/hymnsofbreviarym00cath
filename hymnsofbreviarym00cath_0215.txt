86 Summi Parentis Filio

UMMI Parentis Filio,

Patri futuri saeculi,
Pacis beatae Principi,
Promamus ore canticum.

2Qui vulneratus pectore
Amoris ictum pertulit,
Amoris urens ignibus

Ipsum qui amantem diligunt.

³Jesu, doloris victima,

Quis te innocentem compulit,

Dura ut apertum lancea
Latus pateret vulneri?

⁴0 fons amoris inclyte!
Ο vena aquarum limpida,
O flamma adurens crimina!
Ο cordis ardens caritas!

⁵In Corde, Jesu, jugiter
Reconde nos, ut uberi
Dono fruamur gratiae,
Coelique tandem praemiis.

⁶Semper Parenti, et Filio,
Sit laus, honor, sit gloria,
Sancto simul Paraclito
In saeculorum saecula.

THOU‚ the Son of God most
Thou ngtlffilr, of the life to be,
O Prince of Peaee, to Thee we cry,
We bring our song of praise to

Thee.

Thy Heart was wounded by the
Ordaintleliobvf everlasting love;

Such love among Thy flocks below
Thou kindlest at the fires above.

Dear Christ in pity for our woe

Thou didst Thyself as victim give,

The cruel pange to undergo,

To ope Thy breast that man might
live.

Ο sacred fount of love sublime,
Ο living spring of waters free,
Ο fire to cleanse away all crime,
Ο Heart aflame with charity.

Lord, keep us ever in Thy Heart,

Thy tender love to feel and know,

The joys of heaven to us impart,

When we shall leave these walks
below.

Glory to Father and to Son,

And to the Holy Ghost the same,
To whom all power, when time is
And englis} rule, in endless fame.
