DIES IRAE

F aint and weary Thou hast sought me,
On the Cross of suffering bought me;
Shall such grace be vainly brought me?

Righteous Judge! for sin’s pollution
Grant Thy gift of absolution,
Ere that day of retribution.

Guilty, now I pour my meaning,
All my shame with anguish owning;
Spare, Ο God‚ Thy suppliant groaning!

Through the sinful woman shriven,
Through the dying thies forgiven,
Thou to me a hope hast given.

Worthless are my prayers and sighing,
Yet, good Lord, in grace complying‚
Rescue me from fires undying.

With Thy favored sheep Ο place me,
Nor among the goats abase me,
But to Thy right hand upraise me.

While the wicked are confounded,

Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,
Call me with Thy Saints surrounded.

Low I kneel‚ with heart submission,
Crushed to ashes in contrition;
Help me in my last condition!

Ah! that day of tears and mourning!
From the dust of earth returning‚
Man for judgment must prepare him3
Spaoe, Ο God‚ in mercy spare him!
Lord all-pitying‚ Jesu Blest,

Grant them Thine eternal rest.
