Amnon: St. Bernard (1091-1153). Macrum Iambic
dimeter. TRANSLATION by Father Caswall. LITURGIOAL
Usn: This and the two following centos are used on the
Feast of the Holy N ame, which is celebrated on the Sun—
day between the Circumcision and the Epiphany, or failing
such a Sunday, on January 2d.

The complete hymn as found in the Benedictine edition
of the Opera of St. Bernard contains forty-eight stanzas.
There are six translations of the complete hymn. Many
centos from the hymn, including the three given here for
Vespers, Matins‚ and Lauds, have been translated more
frequently. There are two translations of these three
centos in Mr. Shipley’s Annus Sanctus.

The J esu dulcis memoria is a hymn of surpassing sweet·
ness, and it has been universally accorded a place among
the greatest hymns of the Ohurch. According to Mr.
James Mearns, the assistant editor of Julian's Dictionary
of Hymnoloyy, this hymn is “The finest and most charac-
teristic specimen of St. Bernard's ‘subjective loveliness’
and its honied sweetness vindicates his title of ‘Doctor
Melifiuus.' '’ Father Caswall’s much admired translation
preserves much of the “honied sweetness’' of the original.

The ascription of this hymn to St. Bernard has been
called in question. Dom Pothier has discovered 3 copy of
it in manuscripts of about the year 1070, in which it is
ascribed to a Benedictine abbess. Father Blume‚ S.J.‚ in
the article on Hymnody in the cath. Encycl. pronounces
against its ascription to St. Bernard. On the other hand
Mr. J ames Mearns says: “This hymn has been generally
(and there seems little reason to doubt correctly) ascribed
to St. Bernard.'' (Dict. of H ymnol.) There is an article on
this hymn in the Index Vol. of the Gath. Encycl.

1. “Jesus! how sweet is the very thought! giving true
joys of heart3 but surpassing honey and all sweetness is
His sweet presence.'' Supply est in lines 1 and 4. The
Holy N ame has Jesu in all the cases except the nom. and
acc.

2. “Nothing more sweet can be sung, nothing more
pleasant can be heard, nothing more lovely can be thought

of, than Jesus, the Son of God.''
