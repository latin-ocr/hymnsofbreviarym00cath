Auernos: Francesco Maria Lorenzini (1680-1743).
Mmmz: Iambic dimeter. TRANSLATION by Father Caswall.
There are four translations. LITURGIGAL USE: Hymn for
Vespers and Matius. St. Juliana was the foundress of the
Third Order of Servites. She died in the year 1341.

1. “When thou, O Juliana, didst seek the nuptials of the
Heavenly Lamb, thou didst abandon thy father's house and
lead a choir of virgins.'' For an explanation of the term
“Nuptials of the Heavenly Lamb,'' see the article on
Marriaye, MysticaL in the cath. Encycl.

2. “By day and night thou didst bewail thy Spouse
fastened to the Oross, till pierced with a sword of sorrow
thou didst bear the image of thy Spouse.'' Cuspide, a
sharp point,

3. “Yea, with a sevenfold wound thou didst weep at the
feet of the Mother of God, but by thy tears, the charity in-
fused increased and rendered more keen the poignancy
(flammas) of thy grief.'’ Septiformi vulnere: The seven
Sorrows of our Blessed Mother. Flammas, sc. doloris.
Tears of sorrow increase the love of God in our hearts and
thereby render the greatest sorrows more endurable.

4. “Hence it was that exhausted by the approach of
death, in no ordinary manner did Grod console and nourish
thee, spreading out before thee Heavenly Food.'' There
is reference in this stanza to a miraculous image found on
the Saint’s breast after her death. “Being unable to re-
ceive Holy Communion because of constant vomiting, she
requested the priest to spread a corporal on her breast and
lay the Host on it. Shortly afterwards the Host disap-
peared and Juliana expired, and the image of a cross,
such as had been on the Host, was found on her breast''
(Carth. EncycL).

5. “Eternal Creator of the world, Eternal Son equal to
the Father, and Spirit equa] to both: to Thee alone
(Ο Trinity) be glory.'’
