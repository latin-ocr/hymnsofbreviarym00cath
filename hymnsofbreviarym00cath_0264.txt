PROPER OF SAINTS

This is a continuation of the preceding hymn. TRANSLA-
TION by Father Caswall. LITURGICAL USE: Hymn for
Matins 011 the Feast of St. Hermengild.

1. “By no blandishments could thy father seduce thee,
nor wert thou captivated by the leisure of a life of affluence‚
nor by the sparkling of gems, nor by the desire of reign-
ing.''

2. “The sharp edge of the swerd, with dire threats, did
not terrify thee, nor did the destructive rage of the execu-
tioner; for thou didst prefer the abiding joys of the

Blessed to transitory ones.''
3. “Do thou now from the mansions of the Blessed

graciously protect us, and with willing ear receive our
prayers, while we celebrate in song the martyr's palm ob-
tained by thy death.''
