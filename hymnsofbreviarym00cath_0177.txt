WHITSUNTIDE

Easter. The Easter and Pentecost of the Jews were figures
of the Christian festivals. The Pentecost of the Old Law
was the festival on which was celebrated the “ingathering''
of, and also the thanksgiving for the harvest (cf. Ex. 34,
223 Deut. 16, 9-10). See also the article on Whitsunday,
in the Gath. Encycl.

Behold the appointed morn appear

In solemn mystery sublime!

Seven times sevenfold this earthly sphere
Revolving, marked the blessed time.

-Ι, D. Chambers.

3. “When at the third hour of day the whole world sud-
denly resounds, and announces to the praying Apostles
that God is come.’' Deum = Spiritum Sanctum.

4. “Of the Father's light, therefore, is that beauteous,
kindly flame, which fills with the fervor of the Word the
hearts of those believing in Ohrist.'' Fidus is generally
followed by the dative, but in poetry also by the genitive.
Or, fida pectora, Christ’s faithful souls. Calore verbi : This
may be interpreted as in Neale's version, viz. “To fill with
fervor of His word.’' It would then refer to the gift of
fervid eloquence with which the Apostles were endowed.
Or Verbum might preferably be rendered: the Word, the
eternal Son of God. Note the following:

To warm each faithful breast below
With Christ, the Lord’s all-quickening glow.
-F ather Aylward.

5. “Filled therewith (sc. calore verbi), their hearts, in—
spired by the Holy Ghost, rejoice, and speaking divers
tongues, they proclaim the wondrous works of. God.”

6. “At one and the same time, they (each one) spoke to
the astonished people in the tongues of all, and they were
understood by all, Greeks, Romans, and Barbarians.”
N oti (sunt). Cwnctis, etc„ are in the dative with the pas-
sive, not the ablative. Read the article on Tonyues, Gift
of, in the Cath. Encycl.

7. “Then faithless Judea, rendered insane by its savage
spirit, accuses the sober, faithful followers of Christ of
being drunk with new wine.'’ J udaea, i.e., the Jews.
