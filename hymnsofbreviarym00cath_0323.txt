REGIS superni nuntia, GOD’S messenger, Theresa,
Domum paternam deseris, Thou leav’st thy father’s

Or gain sweet martyrdom.

²Sed te manet suavior But milder death awaits thee,
Mors, poena poscit dulcior: And fonder pains are thine‚
Divini amoris cuspide God’s blessed Angel wounds thee
Ῑ11 vulnus icta concides. With fire of love divine.

³ Ο caritatis victima! Sweet virgin, love’s pure viatim,
Tu corda nostra concrema, So fire our souls with love,
