AUTHOR'S PREFACE

metrical translations. There are no prose translations in
English, if one excepts a considerable part of the hymns of
the Proper of the Season, which are found in Abbot
Gueranger’s great work The Lituryical Y ear. The metrical
versions given here represent the work of more than sixty
translators‚ some of whom flourished as early as the seven-
teenth century. In the selection of these translations many
hymn-collections and many of the finest hymn-books have
been laid under tribute. Catholic and Anglican scholars,
especially since the days of the Oxford Movement, have
vied with one another in rendering our Latin hymns into
English verse. Both in the number of translators and in
the quality of their work the honors are about equally di-
vided. It is worthy of note that Catholic scholars have
ordinarily translated the Roman Breviary Text, while
Anglicans have generally rendered the Original Text as
found in the Benedictine and Dominican Breviaries. Much
time was spent in the selection of the translations that ac-
company the Latin hymns. Despite the great wealth of
translations the editor is inclined to believe that the num-
ber of really good versions of any particular hymn is not
great. A translation, to be worthy of the name, must com-
bine good idiomatic English with a litera] rendering of the
original. The retention of the meter of the original is also
very desirable. Some translatore have excelled in one of
these qualities‚ some in another; few have successfully
combined all of them. In not a few instances it was found
necessary to restrict the choice of translations to those
made directly from the Roman Breviary Text. Osten how-
ever the two Texts while differing verbally do not differ
greatly in sense. In such instances translations of the
Original Text by J. M. N eale and others are freely given.
It was a part of the instruction given the revisers of the
hymns in 1632 that the meter and sense of each line should
be preserved, and that expressions should not be funda-
mentally altered. It need scarcely be said that this in-
struction was not always followed.

Whenever ascertainable the name of the translator of
each hymn is given. Statements as to authorship do not as
a rule include Doxologies‚ Latin or English. Considerable
