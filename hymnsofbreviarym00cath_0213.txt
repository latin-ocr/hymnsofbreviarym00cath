THE SACRED HEART

1. “O Heart, Thou ark, which dost contain the law, not
the law of ancient servitude, but of grace, of pardon, and
of mercy.'’ The Old Law was a law of servitude, and was
eminently suited to the hard-heartedness of the Jews. It
was a law of sear and bondage given amid thunders, and
appropriately engraved on stone. The New Law, on the
contrary, is a law of love and liberty engraved by the Holy
spirit on the hearts of the faithful.

2. “O Heart, undefiled sanctuary of the New Law,
temple more sacred than that of old, and veil more useful
than that which was rent.'' Vetusto (templo); scisso
(velo). Velum, cf. Matt. 27, 51.

3. “Thy love hath willed that Thou be wounded with an
open wound, that we might (see and) venerate the wounds
of Thy invisible love.'' I otus, blow, stroke, stab. Patenti,
abl. of pres. part. of patere, 2, to be open.

4. “Under this symbol of love, He suffered in a bloody
and mystica] manner; and Christ as priest offered a two-
fold sacrifice.'' The twofold sacrifice is that of Calvary
(cruenta) and the Mass (mystica).

5. “Who would not love in return one loving him? Who,
redeemed, would not love (his Redeemer), and choose in
that Heart an eternal dwelling place?'’

85 Quicumque certum quaeritis

UICUMQUE certum quaeritis ALL ye who seek a comfort sure

Rebus levamen asperis: In trouble and distress‚

Seu culpa mordet anxia, Whatever sorrow vex the mind,
Seu poena vos premit comes. Or guilt the soul oppress:
²Jesu‚ qui, ut agnus innocens, Iesus, who gave Himself for you
Sese immolandum tradidit, Upon the Cross to die,
Ad cor reclusum vulnere, Opens to you His sacred Heart;
Ad mite cor accedite. Ο to that Heart draw nigh.
³Auditis ut suavissimis Ye hear how kindly he invites;
Invitet omnes vocibus: Ye hear His words so blest:
Venite quos gravat labor “All ye that labor come to Me,
Premitque pondus criminum: And I will give you rest.’'
