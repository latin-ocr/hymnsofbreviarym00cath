HORA novissima, tempora pes-

sima sunt3 vigilemus.
Ecce minaciter imminet arbiter
Ille supremus,—

Imminet, imminet, ut mala ter-
minet, aequa coronet,

Recta remuneret, anxia liberet,
aethera donet.

Curre, vir optime3 lubrica re-
prime, praefer honesta,

Fletibus angere, flendo merebere
coelica festa.

Luce replebere jam sine vespere,
jam sine luna3

Lux nova lux ea, lux erit aurea,
lux erit una.

Patria splendida, terraque florida,
libera spinis,
Danda fidelibus est ibi civibus,
hic peregrinis.

Tunc erit omnibus inspicientibus
ora Tonantis

Summa potentia, plena scientia,
pax rata sanctis.

Hic homo nititur, ambulat, utitur3
ergo fruetur.

Pax, rata pax ea, spe modo,
postea re capietur.

H ora novissima

THE world is very evil;

The times are waxing late;
Be sober and keep vigil,
The Judge is at the gate;

The Judge that comes in memy,
The J udge that comes with might,
To terminate the evil,

To diadem the right.

Arise, arise, good Christian,
Let right to wrong succeed3
Let penitential sorrow

To heavenly gladness lead,

To the light that hath no evening,
That knows nor moon nor sun,
The light so new and golden,
The light that is but one.

O home of fadeless splendor,
Of flowers that bear no thorn,

Where they shall dwell as children

Who here as exiles mourn;

Midst power that knows no lima,
Where knowledge has no bound,
The Beatific Vision

shall glad the Saints around.

Strive, man, to win that glory;
Toil‚ man, to gain that light;
Send hope before to grasp it,
Till hope be lost in sight.
