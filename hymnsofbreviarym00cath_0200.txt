PROPER OF THE SEASON

Recedant vetera, nova sint omnia,
Corda, voces, et opera.

2N0ctis recolitur eoena novissima,

Qua Christus creditur agnum et
azyma

Dedisse fratribus, juxta legitima

Priscis indulta patribus.

3Post agnum typicum, expletis
epulis,

Corpus Dominicum datum dis·
cipulis,

Sic totum omnibus, quod totum
singulis,

Ejus fatemur manibus.

“Dedit lfragilibus corporis fercu-
um,

Dedit et tristibus sanguinis pocu-
lum,
Dicens: accipite quod trado

vasculum,
Omnes ex eo bibite.

⁵Sie sacrificium istud instituit,

Cujus officium committi voluit

Solis presbyteris, quibus sic
congruit,

Ut sumant, et dent ceteris.

⁶Panis angelicus fit panis homi-
num;

Dat panis coelicus figuris termi-
num:

Ο res mirabilis, manducat Domi-
num

Pauper, servus, et humilis.

⁷ Te trina Deitas unaque poscimus,
Sic nos tu visita, sicut te coli·
mus:

And all be new around,
In ev'ry act and voice and heart.

Remember we that eve,

When, the Last Supper spread,
Christ, as we all believe,

The lamb, with leavenless bread,
Among His brethren shared,
And thus the Law obeyed,

Of old unto their sires declared.

The typic lamb consumed,

The legal Feast complete,

The Lord unto the Twelve

His Body gave to eat;

The whole to all, no less

The whole to each, did mete

With His own hands, as we
confess.

He gave them, weak and frail,
His Flesh, their food to be;

On them, downcast and sad,

His Blood bestowed He:

And thus to them He spake,
“Receive this Cup from Me,

And all of you of this partake.”

So He this Sacrifice

To institute did will,

And charged His priests alone
That office to fulfil:

In them He did confide:

To whom pertaineth still

To take, and to the rest divide.

Thus Angels’ Bread is made
The Bread of man to-day:

The Living Bread from Heaven
With figures doth away:

Ο wondrous gift indeed!

The poor and lowly may

Upon their Lord and Master seed.

O Triune Deity,
To Thee we meekly pray,
So mayst Thou visit us,
