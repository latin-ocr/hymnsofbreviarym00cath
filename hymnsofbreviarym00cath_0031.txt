HISTORICAL

The second period of hymn-writing embraces the period
between the ninth and the sixteenth century. It was a.
period of the greatest activity. Many of the medieval
hymn-writers were· exeeedingly prolific, and a mere men—
tion of the names of those who distinguished themselves
would be a lengthy task. The hymn-writers of the Mid-
dle Ages allowed themselves greater liberty than the earlier
Christian poets, and in general the rules of prosody were
disregarded. It is noticeable also that the hymns of this
period became more subjective than the somewhat austere
hymns of St. Ambrose and his imitators. Popular sub-
jects were—the Passion and Wounds of Christ, His Holy
Ν ame, the Joys of Paradise‚ the Terrors of the Judgment‚
hymns in honor of Our Lady and of the Saints. Among
the great names of this period is that of St. Thomas Aquinas
(d. 1274), the poet of the Blessed Sacrament; Bernard of
Oluny (12th cent), author of De Contempta Mundi, a poem
of 3,ΟΟΟ lines which is well known to English readers from
Neale’s translations—“The world is very evil,'' and
“Jerusalem the golden‚'' which are found at the end of
this volume. To this period also belongs Adam of St.
Victor, the author of many sequences of incomparable
beauty, and the most prominent and prolific hymn-writer of
the Middle Ages. To these great names must be added
that of Jacopone da Todi (d. 1306), the author of the ten-
derest of all poems, the Stabat Mater,· and the still greater
name of Thomas of Celano (d. circa 1255), the immortal
author of the greatest of uninspired compositions‚ the
Dies Irae.

The third period of Latin hymn—writing extends to the
present day. It is not a period marked by any great names
nor has it been productive of any noteworthy new school
of hymn-writers. As in all worldly things a period of
growth and activity is followed by a period of decay. The
art of Latin hymn-writing did not prove to be an exception
to this rule. With the close of the Ages of Faith the sun
of Latin hymnody set in all its splendor. Two causes con—
spired to make Latin hymn-writing a lost art. During the
ages when hymnody flourished men thought in Latin and
spoke Latin3 for them Latin was a living language, and one
