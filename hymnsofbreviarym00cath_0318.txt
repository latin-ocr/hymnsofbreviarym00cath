PROPER OF SAINTS

2. The Visitation: “The Virgin visits one related to her
by blood, the mother of John, who, though still enclosed in
the womb, exultingly proclaims that Christ is present.''
Exultavit infans in utero ejus (Luke 1, 41). Propinquam
sawyuine, Elizabeth‚ Mary’s cousin (Luke 1, 36); read the
remainder of this chapter of St. Luke. It gives an account
of the Visitation, and in it are found the two sublime
Evangelical Canticles, the Magnificat (verses 46-55), and

the Benedictus (verses 68-79).
3. The N ativz'ty: “The Word that from all eternity had

proceeded from the intellect of the Father is born a mortal
infant from the womb of a Virgin-Mother.'' Verbum, the
Eternal Son (Of. John 1, 1-14).

4. The Presentation: “The Child is presented in the
temple, the Lawgiver obeys the Law, here the Redeemer
offers Himself, and is redeemed by the offering of the
poor.’' The Law (Leviticus 12, 6-8) specified the offerings
that must be made by the rich and by the poor on the puri-
fication of a woman after childbirth. The latter were re-
quired to offer a sacrifice of “a pair of turtle doves, or two
young pigeons'' (Of. Luke 2, 22-24). Mary made the
offering of the poor, and did for Him “according to the
custom of the Law'' (Luke 2, 27). The purification of the
mother, and the redemption of the Child (Num. 18, 15)
were quite different legal prescriptions‚ but it is reasonable
to suppose that both ceremonies took place at the same
time. Read the beautiful Canticle of Simeon (Luke 2, 29-

5. The Findiny in the Temple: “Now the gioyful Mother
finds her Son whom she had already mourned as lost; finds
Him expounding to learned minds things they did not

know. ’ ’

Sudore manans sanguinis. His soul is sorrowful to death,
His sweat of blood bedews the

sod.
