INTRODUCTION

These meters or verse forms receive their name partly from
the foot that chiefly predominates in them 3 as, Iambic,
Trochaic, and partly from the number of meters or meas-
ures they contain3 as, Dimeter, Trimeter3 or from the
name of the author who originated or employed a certain
kind of verse: as, Sapphio, Glyconie, Asclepiadic‚ etc.

By far the greater part of the hymns is written in
Iambic and Trochaic meters. In these meters Latin verses
are measured not by single feet as in English, but by pairs
or dipodies. In Latin it requires four Iambi or Trochees to
make a Dimeter, while in English a verse with the same
number of feet is called a Tetrameter. A Dimeter, there-
fore, in these meters, contains four Iambi or Trochees3 a
Trimeter six5 and a Tetrameter eight.

The Romans learned their poetry, as they learned the
other fine arts, from the Greeks. About two centuries be-
fore Christ the influence of Greek poetry began to manifest
itself in the writings of Ennius, “the Father of Roman
poetry.’' The influence of Greek models increased from
year to year till it culminated in the immortal works of
Horace and Virgil in the Golden Age of Latin literature.
Horace exemplifies all that is best in Latin poetry, and it
was the poetry of Horace and his contemporaries that was
the delight of the cultured Romans whose taste had been
formed on Greek models. This poetry, it need scarcely be
said, was strictly quantitative.

But together with this Classical poetry there co-existed,
and that too from the beginning of Latin letters, a
purely rhythmieal poetry, a poetry of the people, in which
the ballads and folk songs of the common people were
written. The common people knew nothing of quantity
with its artifioial and arbitrary rules which the poets had
made. Quantitative poetry was therefore the poetry of the
educated3 rhythmieal or accentual poetry was the poetry
of the common people. Now, the early hymns of the
Church were likewise the songs of the people, and were
necessarily written in a manner that would appeal to all
the people and not merely to the cultured classes. This
was effeeted by St. Ambrose and by the earlier writers
of the Ambrosian school, by a compromise between the
