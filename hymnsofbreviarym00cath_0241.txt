THE HOLY FAMILY

“Qua vestra sedes floruit Your home was as a garden

Virtutis omnis gratia, Made glad with fairest flowers3
Hanc detur in domesticis May life thus blossom sweetly
Referre posse moribus. In every home of ours.
⁷Jesu, tibi sit gloria7 Jesus‚ to Thee be glory‚

Qui natus es de Virgine, The Maiden-Mother’s Son,
Cum Patre, et almo Spiritu, With F ather and with Spirit
In sempiterna saeoula. While endless ages run.
