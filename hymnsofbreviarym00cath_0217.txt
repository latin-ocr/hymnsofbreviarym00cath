DIES IRAE

⁸ Tuba mirum spargens sonum
Per sepulchra regionum,
Coget omnes ante thronum.

⁴'Mors stupebit, et natura,
Cum resurget creatura,
Judicanti responsura.

⁶Liber scriptus proferetur,
In quo totum continetur,
Unde mundus judicetur.

“Judex ergo cum sedebit,
Quidquid latet, apparebit:
Nil inultum remanebit.

⁷Quid sum, miser, tunc dicturus?
Quem patronum rogaturus?
Cum vix justus sit securus?

⁸ Rex tremendae majestatis,
Qui salvandos salvas gratis,
Salva me, fons pietatis.

⁹ Recordare, Jesu pie,
Quod sum causa tuae viae:
Ne me perdas illa die.

¹⁰ Quaerens me, sedisti lassus:
Redemisti crucem passus:
Tantus labor non sit cassus.

And summon all before the throne.

Now Death and Nature in amaze
Behold the Lord His creatures

To megtaltbee Judge’s awful gaze.

And evgrwyn9 secret thing makes

No crime escapes His vengeful

Ah, how shall I that day endure?

What patron’s friendly voice se·

When ἓὲζῗέῑε the just themselves
are sure?

O King of dreadful majesty,
Who grantest grace and mercy
Grant ιξιέῖίἷν now and grace to me.

Good Lord, ’twas for my sinful
That 'Is'llllotii our suffering flesh
didst take;

Then do not now my soul forsake.

In weariness Thy sheep was
sought;

Upon the Cross His

Alas, if all in vain were wrought.
