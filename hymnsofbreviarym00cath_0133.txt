PASSIONTIDE

51 Vexilla Regis prodeunt

'VEXILLA Regis prodeunt:

Fulget Crucis mysterium,

Qua vita mortem pertulit,
Et morte vitam protulit.

²Quae vulnerata lanceae
Mucrone diro, criminum
Ut nos lavaret sordibus,
Manavit unda, et sanguine.

⁸ Impleta sunt quae concinit
David fideli carmine,
Dicendo nationibus:
Regnavit a ligno Deus.

‘Arbor decora et fulgida,
Ornata regis purpura,
Electa digno stipite
Tam sancta membra tangere.

⁶ Beata, cujus brachiis
Pretium pependit saeculi,
Statera facta corporis,
Tulitque praedam tartari.

⁶0 Crux ave spes unica,
Hoc passionis ternpore
Piis adauge gratiam,
Reisque dele crimina.

ABROAD the Regal Banners fly,

Now shines the Cross’s mys·
Upon stega did death endum,
And yet by death did life procure.

Who, wounded with a direful
spear,

Did, purposely to wash us clear

From stain of sin, pour out a flood

Of precious Water mixed with

Blood.

That which the Prophet-King of
Hath inoiiiiysterious verse foretold‚
Is now accomplished, whilst we
God rulineg nations from a Tree.

O lovely and refulgent Tree,
Adorned with purpled majesty;
Culled from a worthy stock, to
Those bffirlnbs which sanctified

were.

Blest Tree, whose happy branches

The nglrtssl that did the world
restore;

The bearn that did that Body

Which Ἔξὲιᾶ up hell's expected
prey.

Han, Cross, of hopes the most
sublime!

Now in this mournful Passion

time,
Improve religious souls in grace,
The sins of criminals efface.
