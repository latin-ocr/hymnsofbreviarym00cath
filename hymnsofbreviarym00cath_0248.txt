courage us who waver.’'

99 Aurora soli praevia

AURORA soli praevia

Felix salutis nuntia,
In noctis umbra plebs tua
Te, Virgo, supplex invocat.

²Torrens nefastis fluctibus
Cunctos trahens voragine,
Leni residit aequore
Cum transit Arca foederis.

²Dum torret arescens humus,
Tu rore sola spargeris3
Tellure circum rorida,
Intacta sola permanes.

⁴Fatale virus evomens
Attollit anguis verticem;
At tu draconis turgidum
Invicta conteris caput.

¹⁵Mater benigna, respice

Fletus precesque supplicum,

Et dimicantes tartari
Victrix tuere ab hostibus.

⁶Jesu, tibi sit gloria,
Qui natus es de Virgine,
Cum Patre, et almo Spiritu,
In sempiterna saecula.

ROSY dawn! that dost pro-

claim

Salvation’s happy day,

To thee, O Virgin‚ ’mid night's
shades,

Thy people humbly pray.

The torrent, that engulfs all those

Within its whirlpool drawn,

Rests calm as o’er its sostened
wave

The ark of God is borne.

While earth is parched with
scorching heat,

Alone thou art bedewed3

With dew o’erspread the earth
around,

And thou untouched art viewed.

The serpent rears his head aloft
Disgorging poisoned spleen;

But thou his prend, inflated head
Dost crush with power as Queen.

O loving Mother‚ hear our prayer,
As suppliant we cry3

Protect us in our strife with hell
Who dost its power defy.

O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
All glory be to Thee,
With F ather and with paraclete,

Through all eternity.
