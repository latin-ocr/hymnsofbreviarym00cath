CORPUS CHRISTI

Trochaic dimeter, in great part. TRANSLATION by Monsignor
Henry. There are about twenty translations, two of which
are in the Annus Sanctus. LITURGICAL Usn: Sequence for
the Feast of Corpus Christi, and throughout the octave.

1. “Praise, O Sion, thy Saviour, praise thy Leader and
thy Shepherd in hymns and canticles. As much as thou
canst, so much darest thou, for He is above all praise, nor
art thou able to praise Him enough.'' Sion: the faithful,
the Ohurch, see Glossary. M ajor: Benedicentes Dominum,
exaltate illum‘quantum potestis: major enim est omni laude
(cf. Ecclus. 43, 32-34).

2. “To—day there is given us a special theme of praise,
the Bread b0ffl1 living and life-giving, which, it is not to be
doubted, was given to the assembly of the brethren, twelve
in number, at the table of the holy Supper.'⁷ Quem . . . .
datum esse. For duodena? see denus in the Glossary.

3. “Let our praise be full and sounding3 let the jubila-
tions of the soul be joyous and becoming; for that solemn
day is now being celebrated, on which is commemorated the
first institution of this table.'' Mensoe, table, the Holy
Eucharist.

4. “At this table of the new King, the new Pasch of
the N ew Law puts an end to the ancient Pasch. The new
supplants the old, truth puts to fiight the shadow, day
banishes night.'' Pascha: the Pasch, Passover (cf. Exod.
12-13). Phasc: This is another form of Pascha and has
the same meaning (cf. Exod. 12, 213 34, 253 Num. 9, 4).
The English word Phoese occurs only in the Douay Bible.
The expressions “The new supplants the old,'' etc., refer
to the institution of the N ew Sacrifice foretold by Malachias
(1, 10-11), of which the sacrifices of the Old Law were but
shadows, types, and figures.

5. “What Christ did at that Supper, the same He com-
manded to 'be done in remembrance of Him. Taught by
His sacred precepts, we consecrate bread and wine into the
Victim of salvation.''

6. “This is the dogma given to Christians, that bread
is changed into Flesh and wine into Blood. What thou dost
not understand, what thou dost not see, a lively faith con—
firms in a supernatura] manner.’' Praeter rerum ordinem:
