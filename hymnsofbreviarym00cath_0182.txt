PROPER OF THE SEASON

74 O Deus, ego amo te
Ο DEUS, ego amo te, MY God, I love Thee, not be-
Nec amo te, ut salves me, cause
Aut quia non amantes te I hope for heaven thereby3
AEterno punis igne. Nor yet since they who love Tbee
not

Must burn eternally.

²Tu, tu, mi Jesu, totum me Thou, Ο my Jesus, Thou didst me
Amplexus es in cruce3 Upon the Cross embrace3
Tulisti clavos, lanceam, For me didst bear the nails and
Multamque ignominiam, spear,

And manifold disgrace3
⁸Innumeros dolores, And griefs and torments number·
Sudores‚ et angores, less,
Et mortem, et haec propter me, And sweat of agony3
Ac pro me peccatore. E’en death itself 3 and all for one
Who was Thine enemy.

‘Cur igitur non amem te, Then why, O blessed Jesus Christ,
O Jesu amantissime, Should I not love Thee well,
Non, ut in coelo salves me, Not for the sake of winning
Aut ne aeternum damnes me, heaven,

Or of escaping hell;

⁵Nec praemii ullius spe, Not with the hope of gaining
Sed sicut tu amasti me? aught‚

Sic amo et amabo te, Not seeking a reward3

Solum quia Rex meus es, But as Thyself hast loved me,

Et solum quia Deus es. O ever-loving Lord?

E’en so Ῑ love Thee, and will love,
And in Thy praise will sing,
Solely because Thou art my God,
And my eternal King.
