FTER years of patient but loving labor, the
compiler of this volume has achieved a work of

ᾖ scholarly distinction, of elegant artistry, and
withal of practica] utility.

It is a work of scholarly distinction. The
field of Latin hymnology is vast in extent and rich in re-
sources, and translators have roamed far and wide amid its
fertile reaches for highly varied blooms and fruits. The
compiler has therefore had many rich stores to draw upon,
but he has wisely restricted himself to very definite limits
of choice. The hymns of the Roman Missal and Breviary
form a thesaurus by themselves. Many of. them are world-
famous classics. Some of them have won translation and
commentary that fill volumes devoted to them singly. All
of them deserve rendition into English verse and, indeed,
have been more than once so rendered. Father Caswall and
Archbishop Bagshawe, each for his own day, translated all
of the Missal and Breviary hymns. Caswall did more, it is
true, finding other treasures in the Parisian and various
Monastic Breviaries. His competency for the task he es-
sayed was manifold and excellent, and his Lyra Catholica
will doubtless forever remain a Catholic classic. Bagshawe
confined his attention to the Roman liturgical hymns, set-
ting himself the somewhat ungrateful task of closely literal
translation. In our own day, Judge Donahoe has published
two series of Early Christian H ymas, including very many
from the Roman liturgy, and has merited the high praise
accorded him by critics. Catholic renderings into English
of individual liturgical hymns are well-nigh innumerable.
While Catholics have naturally been active in such appro—
pria-te work, it may seem at first blush astonishing that
