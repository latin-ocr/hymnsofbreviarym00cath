GLORY and honor and laud he to Thee‚ King Christ the Redeemer!

Children of old in whose praise sweetest hosannas outpoured.
Israel’s Monareh art Thou, and the glorious Offspring of David,
Thou that approachest, a King, blest in the name of the Lord.

Glory and honor and laud, etc.

Glory to Thee upon high, the heavenly armies are singing;
Glory to Thee upon earth, man and creation reply.
Glory and honor and laud, etc.

Met Thee with palms in their hands, that day the folk of the Hebrews;

We with our prayers and our hymns, now to Thy presence approach.
Glory and honor and laud, etc.

They to Thee proffered their praise, for to herald Thy dolorous
We to ῒιῖιῗῗέῗὲἐ on His throne, utter the jubilant hymn.
Glory and honor and laud, eto.

They were then pleasing to Thee‚ unto Thee our devotion be pleasing3
Merciful King, kind King, who in all goodness art pleased.
Glory and honor and laud, ete.
