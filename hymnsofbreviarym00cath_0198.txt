Troehaio tetrameter. TRANSLATION by Father Caswall.
There are about twenty-five translations, eight of which
are in Mr. Shipley's Annus Sanctus. LITURGIGAL UsE:
Vespers hymn on the Feast of Corpus Christi: the Tantum
Eryo and doxology are sung during Benediction of the
Blessed Sacrament. It is used also as a processional hymn
on Holy Thursday‚ Corpus Christi, and during the Forty
Hours' Adoration.

The Pange Lingtua is pre-eminently the hymn of the Most
Blessed Saorament. It is the most beautiful of the great
Eucharistic hymns of st. Thomas. “This hymn,'' says
Dr. N eale, “contests the second place among those of the
Western Churoh with the Vexilla Reyis, the Stabat Mate-r,
the J esu dulcis memoria, the Ad regias Α qni dapes, the Ad
Superbam, and one or two others, leaving the Dies Irae in
its unapproaehable glory. It has been a bow of Ulysses to
translators'' (M edieval Hymns, p. 179). The Pasnye
Linyua of St. Thomas is, according to Dr. Julian—“One
of the finest of medieval Latin hymns3 a wonderful union
of sweetness of melody with clear-cut dogmatio teaching''
(Diot. of H ymnoloyy, p. 878). With the addition of rhyme,
St. Thomas imitates in this beautiful hymn the Panye
Linyua of Fortunatus.

1. “Sing, Ο my tongue, the mystery of the glorious
Body and of the precious Blood‚ which the King of the
Gentiles, the fruit of a noble womb, shed for the redemp-
tion of the world.''

2. “Given to us, and born for us of a stainless Virgin, He
dwelt on earth sowing the seed of the word, and closed in
a wondrous manner the days of His earthly sojourning.''
Nobis datus: Parvulus enim natus est nobis et filius datus
est nobis . . . et vocabitur nomen ejus, Admirabilis, Con-
siliarius‚ Deus Fortis, Pater futuri saeouli, Princeps pacis
