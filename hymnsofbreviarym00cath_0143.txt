PASSIONTIDE

‘Pro peccatis suae gentis
Vidit Jesum in tormentis,
Et flagellis subditum:
Vidit suum dulcem Natum

Moriendo desolatum,
Dum emisit spiritum.

⁵Eja Mater, fons amoris,
Me sentire vim doloris
Fac, ut tecum lugeam:
Fac, ut ardeat cor meum
In amando Christum Deum

Ut sibi complaceam.

“'Sancta Mater, istud agas,
Crucifixi fige plagas
Cordi meo valide:
Tui Nati vulnerati,
Tam dignati pro me pati,
Poenas mecum divide.

⁷Fac me tecum pie flere,
Crueifixo condolere,

Donec ego vixero:
Juxta Crucem tecum stare,
Et me tibi sociare

In planctu desidero.

⁸Virgo virginum praeclara,
Mihi jam non sis amara,
Fae me tecum plangere:
Fac ut portem Christi mortem,
Passionis fac consortem,
Et plagas recolere.

⁹Fac me plagis vulnerari,
Fac me Cruce inebriari,
Et cruore Filii.
Flammis ne urar succensus,
Per te, Virgo, sim defensus
In die judieii.

Bruised‚ derided‚ cursed‚ defiled,
She beheld her tender Child

All with bloody scourges rent;
For the sins of His own nation‚

Saw Him hang in desolation‚
Till His spirit forth He sent.

Ο thou Mother! fount of love!
Touch my spirit from above,
Make my heart with thine accord:
Make me feel as thou hast felt;
Make my soul to glow and melt

With the love of Christ my Lord.

Holy Motherl pierce me through;
In my heart each wound renew
Of my Saviour erueified:

Let me share with thee His pain,
Who for all my sins was slain,
Who for me in torments died.

Let me mingle tears with thee,

Mourning Him who mourned for
me,

All the days that I may live:

By the Cross with thee to stay;

There with thee to weep and pray;

Is all I ask of thee to give.

Virgin of all virgins blest!
Listen to my fond request:

Let rne share thy grief divine;
Let me, to my latest breath‚
In my body bear the death
Of that dying Son of thine.

Wounded with His every wound,
Steep my soul till it hath swooned
In His very Blood away3

Be to me, Ο Virgin, nigh,

Lest in flames Ι burn and die,

In that awful Judgment day.
