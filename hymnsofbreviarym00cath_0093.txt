Aut actibus se interserit. Or mingled with the heart’s in-

Da gratiarum munera: stow,

Dissolve litis vincula: And grant Thy gifts of grace
Adstringe pacis foedera. below;

From chains of strife our souls ’

Bind fast the gentle hands of
peace.

Patrique compar Unice, With Christ, Thy sole-begotten
Cum Spiritu Paraelito Son,

Regnans per omne saeculum. Whom, with the Spirit we adore,

One God, both now and evermore.
