PROPER OF THE SEASON
59Β Victima> Paschali

THE holy Paschal work is wrought,

The Victim's praise be told,

The loving Shepherd back hath brought
The sheep into His fold:

The Just and Innocent was slain

To reconcile to God again.

Death from the Lord of life hath fled—
The conflict strange is o’er;
Behold‚ He liveth that was dead,
And lives forevermore:
Mary, thou soughtest Him that day;
Tell what thou sawest on the way.

“I saw the empty cavern’s gloom,
ΤΙιε garments of the prison,
The Angel-guardians of the tomb,
The glory of the Risen.”
We know that Christ hath burst the grave,

Then, victor King‚ Thy people save.

Almique membra corporis
Amor sacerdos immolat.

³Sparsum cruorem postibus
Vastator horret Angelus:
Fugitque divisum mare:
Merguntur hostes fluctibus.

Who hath washed us in the tide

F lowing from His pierced side.

Praise we Him whose love divine
Gives the guests His Blood for

Love the victim, love the priest.

Death’s dark Angel sheathes his
