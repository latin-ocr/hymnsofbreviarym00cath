NATIVITY OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST

andAdonic. TRANSLATION, a cento from The Hymner,
based on a translation by W. J. Blew, in the meter of the
original. There are about twenty translations of this
beautiful hymn. LITURGICAL Usn: Hymn for Vespers.
The hymns given below for Matins and Lauds are parts
of this hymn. The translations are in blank verse. In
reading care should be taken to observe the caesura which
in Sapphic verse occurs generally after the fifth syllable.
There is an article on this hymn in the Gath. Encycl„ and
another on Paulus Diacowus its author.

1. “That thy servants may be able to sing thy deeds of
wonder with pleasant voices, remove, O holy John, the
guilt of our sin-polluted lips.'' Laoeis fibris is intended
to express a good condition of the voice, freedom from
hoarseness, etc„ “with vocal cords well strung.'' St. John
is invoked for ailments of the throat, and he is even con-
sidered a special patron of singers. The Saint's miraculous
birth is recorded in detail in Luke 1. The whole chapter
should be read. Zachary, the father of the Precursor, lost
his voice on account of his disbelief in the Angel's promise
(Luke 1, 19), and again “his tongue was loosed'' (laxis
fibris) at the naming of John (Luke 1, 64). This stanza is
of special interest to musicians as the syllables marked in
italics were those chosen by Guido of Arezzo (990-1050)
for the syllabic naming of the notes Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol,
La. The famuli mentioned in this stanza are the choir who
(as Zachary recovered his voice at the naming of John)
would implore their patron to endow them with voices
worthy of singing the praises of one so illustrious.

2. “A messenger from highest heaven discloses in due
order to thy father that thou wouldst be born great, thy
name, and the whole course of the life thou wouldst lead.''
Nuntius, the Archangel Gabriel (Luke 1, 19). Nomen,
John (Luke 1, 13). Seriem vitae yerendoe (of. Luke 1, 15-

3. “He (Zachary) doubtful of the heavenly promise lost
the power of ready speech3 but when born, thou didst
restore the organs of the lost voice.'' The disbelief of
Zachary is recorded in Luke 1, 183 the penalty in verse 20;
the restoration of the power of speech in verse 64.
