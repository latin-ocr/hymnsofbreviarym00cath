FRIDAY AT LAUDS

‘Quaesita jam primum fides To us strong saith forever give,
In corde radices agat: With joyous hope, in Thee to live;
Secunda spes congaudeat, That life’s rough way may ever be
Qua major exstat caritas. Made strong and pure by charity.

‘Deo Patri sit gloria, All laud to God the Father be,
Ejusque soli Filio, All praise, Eternal Son, to Thee:
Cum Spiritu Paraclim, All glory‚ as is ever meet,

Nunc, et per omne saeculum. To God the holy paraclete.

AUTHOR: Ambrosiam 5th cent. METER: Iambie dimeter.
TRANSLATION by John Julian. There are twelve translations.

1. “Eternal Glory of heaven, blessed hope of mortals,
the only-begotten Son of the most high Thunderer, the
offspring of a chaste Virgin,'’ Tonantis (tono 1) “The
Sovereign Thunderer's only Son.’ ⁷——Abp. Bagshawe. Tona-
bit de coelo Dominus (ΙΙ Kings 22, 14). Of. also Ι Kings 2,
103 ΡΒ. 17, 14; PS. 28, 3.

2. “Give Thy right hand to those who rise3 sober also
may the soul arise, and zealous in the praise of God, return
Him due thanks. ’ ' Sobria, thoughtful, recollected. Grates =
gratias.

3. “The risen morning star shines forth, and as a herald
precedes the sun; the darkness of night disappears3 may
the holy light illuminate us.'’ Lovers of allegory see in
John the Baptist “the morning star‚'' “the herald⁷' that
went before the rising Suri of J ustice.

4. “And dwelling in our hearts, may it dispel the dark-
ness of the world, and may it preserve our hearts unsullied
till the end of time.'' Lux sancta is the subject of the whole
stanza. Noctem saeculi, spiritual darkness, sin.

5. “First may faith long-sought strike deep its roots in
our hearts3 secondly, may hope rejoiee us; but greater still
than these is eharity.'' Qua refers grammatically to spes,
but in sense also to fides, and is therefore equivalent to
quibus. Nunc autem manent fides, spes, caritas, tria haec;
major autem horum est caritas (I Cor. 13, 13). In heaven
saith will be changed into vision, hope into fruition‚ but
charity will remain forever.
