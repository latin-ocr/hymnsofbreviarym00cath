AUTHORS OF THE LATIN' HYMNS

AMBROSE, ST. (340-397), Bishop of Milan, is justly
styled “the Father of Church-song in the West.'' He be-
came, like St. Hilary, a great champion of orthodoxy against
the Arians in the West. And it was while he and his
faithful flock were besieged in his Cathedral by the im-
perial troops that, as St. Augustine tells us, he first com--
posed hymns for them to sing “lest they faint through
fatigue of sorro .’' The simple, austere hymns of St.
Mffiays been considered the ideal in Church-
song. Many hymns have been ascribed 10 him, and there
is some difference of opinion as to what hymns he actually
wrote. The latest authority on this subject is the eminent
hymnologist Father Dreves, who made a careful study of
the early hymnaries in the Vatican and at Milan. He thus
classifies the hymns of St. Ambrose:

I. Certified as his by early writers. AEterne rerum Con-..-

ditor. 2.Q„S,Crea.tstr.nmnium. 3. llluminans altissimus.
Ueni Redemptor gentium. 5. ‚J am surgit hora terna' .

. tzers also yenuzne. 6. AEterna Christi munera, Et
martyrum. 7. Agnes beatae virginis. 8. Amore Christi no-
bilis. 9. Apostolorum passio. 10. Apostolorum supparem.
11. Grates tibi, ι16511, novas. 12. Hic est dies verus Dei. 13.
Splendor paternae gloriae. 14. Victor, Ν abor, Felix, pii.

III. Possibly his. 15. Jesu corona virginum. 16. Nunc,
Sancte nobis Spiritus. 17. Rector potens, verax Deus. 18.
Rerum Deus tenax vigor.

The Benedictine editors of the works of St. Ambrose
assign twelve to him. Among them, and not mentioned
above, ,are the two Breviary hymns: Somno refectis artu-
bus, and Consors paternae luminis.
