AUTHOR: St. Ambrose (340-397). METER: Iambic dimeter.
TRANSLATION from The Yattendon Η ymnal-a spirited
translation. There are about thirty translations. The
Splendor paternas> §lorice has been rightly styled, “A beau—
tiful morning hymn to the Holy Trinity‚ but especially to
Christ as the Light of the World, and a prayer for help and
guidance throughout the day. It is a companion and sequel

Hywmoloyy).

light from light, O Light of Light, and Source of light, Day

represents the Father3 the rays, the Son. The figure must
not be understood as implying any inequality. Lux: Of
Himself, Christ says: Ego sum lux mundi (John 8, 12) 3 He

the light of faith “every man that cometh into this world'’
(John 1,1-9).

2. “Ο Thou, true Sun, descend, shining with everlasting
brightness, and infuse into our hearts the radiance of the
Holy Spirit.'' Illabere, imper. of illabor.

3. “In our prayers, let us also implore the Father, the
Father of eternal glory‚ the Father of mighty grace, that
He may remove every dangerous inclination to sin.'' By
culpa is here meant, the inclination to sin, rather than sin
itself.

4. “May He give us strength for manly deeds, blunt the
teeth of the envious one, bring adverse events to a favor-
