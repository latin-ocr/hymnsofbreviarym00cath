162 J esu corona celsior

ESU corona celsior,
Et veritas sublimior,
Qui confitenti servulo
Reddis perenne praemium:

² Da supplicanti coetui,
Hujus rogatu, noxii
Remissionem criminis,
Rumpendo nexum vinculi.

⁸Anni reverso tempore,
Dies refulsit lumine,
Quo Sanctus hic de corpore
Migravit inter sidera.

⁴Hic vana terrae gaudia,
Et luculenta praedia,
Polluta sorde deputans,
Ovans tenet coelestia.

“Te Christe Rex piissime,
Hic confitendo jugiter,
Calcavit artes daemonum,

Saevumque averni principem.

ESU, eternal Truth sublime,

Thmught endless years the
Thou ciffi-'of those who through
a time

Confess Thy holy Name:

Thy suppliant people, through the

Of Thyprfflg Saint, forgive;

For his dear sake, Thy wrath
forbear, ,

And bid our spirits live.

Again returns the sacred day,
With heavenly glory bright,
Which saw him go upon his way
Into the realrns of light.

All objects of our vain desire,
All earthly joys and gains,

To him were but as filthy mire;
And now with Thee he reigns.

Thee, Jesu, his all-gracious Lord,
Confessing to the last, ’
He trod beneath him Satan’s
And stdhzduiorever fast.
