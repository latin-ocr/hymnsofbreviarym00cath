PROPER OF THE SEASON

for the Second Creation at Easter'’ (Εἰσί. of Hymnoloyy,
p. 576). According to Duffield “It expresses the early
Christian attitude towards God's works, connecting the
looked-for Easter with the renewal of the world by spring'’
(Latin Hywm-Writers and Their Hymns, p. 335).

1. “O J esus, Sun of salvation, shine Thou in our inmost
souls, till, the night having been dispelled, more welcome
day is born anew to the world.'' This is a hymn for Lauds,
which was said at daybreak. As the sun at daybreak dis-
pels the darkness, in like manner we entreat the Sun of
salvation, the true Light of the world, to flood our hearts
with the quickening beams of His grace.

2. “Having given this acceptable time, grant also that
we cleanse with floods of tears the victim of our heart,
which may gladsome charity consume by its flames.''
Tempus acceptabile, a time of grace; Lent is preeminently
a time of grace. Victima, something offered in sacrifice.
There is an allusion here to the purification of the victims
of sacrifice in the Old Law, and to their destruction in whole
or in part by fire. Such for example were the holocausts,
the peace-offerings, and the sacrifices of propitiation. So
too shall “the victim which is our heart'' be purified by
tears of sorrow, and consumed by the flames of an ardent
charity. Ecce nunc tempus acceptabile, ecce nunc dies
salutis (II Cor. 6, 2).

3. “From the selfsame source whence sins arose, shall
ceaseless tears arise, if but the rod of penance break the
icy coldness of the heart.'' Fonte, “the source” is the
heart of man. Ab intus enim de corde hominum malae cogi-
tationes procedunt, adulteria, fornicationes, homicidia
(Mark 7, 21). Virya: The rod is a symbol of chastisement,
and here, of sels-inflicted chastisement.

4. “The day comes, Thy day, on which all shall bloom
anew3 then may we too rejoice, led on the way by Thy
right hand.'' Dies.- The day alluded to may be either J udg—
ment Day or the coming Easter Day.

5. “O loving Trinity, may the whole fabric os the uni-
verse humbly adore Thee, and we, renewed by Thy grace,
would sing Thee a new song of praise.” Prona, prostrate.
