PROPER OF SAINTS

vinclis super terram strinxeris. This hymn is a part of a
longer hymn beginning: Felix per omnes festum mundi
cardines. There are nine stanzas in the complete hymn.
In addition to several anonymous translations in the early
Primers, there are ten later translations, three of which are
translations of the complete hymn. This hymn is evi-
dently later than, and modeled on, the Decora lum which is
used on the Feast of SS. Peter and Paul (June 29).

1. “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth with chains, O
Peter, shall be bound in the stronghold of the skies, and
what here the power bestowed upon thee doth loosen, shall
be loosed in heaven's exalted height3 at the end of the
world thou shalt judge mankind.'' This stanza contains
a metrical rendering of Matt. 16, 19: Et tibi dabo claves
regni coelorum. Et quodcumque ligaveris super terram,
erit ligatum et in coelis: et quodcumque solveris super
terram, erit solutum et in coelis. Judz'cabz’s: Of. Matt. 19,

2. “To God the Father be glory through endless ages;
Eternal Son, may we sing Thy glorious praises; Heavenly
Spirit, to Thee be honor and glory: unceasingly may the
Holy Trinity be praised through all eternity.'’
