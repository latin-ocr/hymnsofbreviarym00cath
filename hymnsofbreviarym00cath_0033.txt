one which the Ohurch may recall at any time, and one which
she probably will recall, for the work of the 151715515 15 now
generally regarded as a mistake. The hymns in their old
form are still found in the Breviaries of the Benedictines,
Dominicans, Cistercians, Carthusians, and probably a few
others. And, strangely enough, they are still used in the
two great Ohurches in Rome, 81. Ρ5151’5 and 81. John
Lateran.

A word yet remains to be said as to when hymns were
first made an integral part of the Divine Office. It seems
fairly certain that 81. Benedict, who wrote his Rule some
ten or fifteen years before 1115 death in 543, was the first to
make hymns an integral part of the canonical hours. St.
Benedict invariably styles these hymns Ambrosiam but
does not name them. A century later hymns constituted a
part of the Office of the secular clergy in Gaul and Spain.
Rabanus Maurus (d. 856) testifies that hymns were in gen-
eral use in his day. And last of all Rome admitted hymns
into the Divine Office in the twelfth century. It must not be
inferred, however, that no hymns were sung in the churches
throughout the West until they were officially recognized
as 3 part of the liturgical Office. From the days of 81.
Ambrose (d. 397) the singing of Latin hymns in the Church
occupied the same position that is now accorded the sing-
ing of hymns in the vernacular. This is true even of con-
servative Rome long before the twelfth century. It might
be recalled that Pope St. Gregory the Great (d. 604), him—
self 3 hymn-writer of note, was for several years before
his elevation to the Papacy a, Benedictine abbot in the mon-
astery of St. Andrew on the Caelian Hill. While there he
must have become familiar with the Ambrosiam of the
Benedictine Office which he sang daily. Nor is it conceiv-
able, from what we know of his life, that as Pope he should
not have encouraged the singing of hymns in the churches
of Rome.

METERS

A considerable variety of meters has been employed by
the Christian poets in the composition of Latin hymns.
