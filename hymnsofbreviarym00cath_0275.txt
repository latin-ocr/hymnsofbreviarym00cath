NATIVITY OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST

TRANSLATION by M. J. Blacker and Gr. H. Palmer. ermzm-
oAL Usn: Hymn for Lauds.

1. “O thrice happy thou, and of exalted merit, knowing
no stain upon thy snow-white purity3 thou mightiest of
martyrs, friend of solitude, greatest of prophets.’'
Nemorum, nemus, a grove, forest, a place of solitude: some
texts have eremi; eremus, desert, wilderness, solitude.

2. “Orowns enriched with thrice tenfold increase adorn
some3 others a double crown adorns; but a triple crown
with fruitage heaped up with a hundred twinings adorns
thee.'’ Oonstr.: Serta (crowns, garlands) aucta ter denis
crementis (increase, fruit) coronat alios, quosdam dupli-
cata serta. coronant; te ornant trina fructu cumulata serta
centum nexibus. The stanza plainly refers to the Parable
of the Sower, some of whose seed falling on good ground
“brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold,
and some thirtyfold'' (Matt. 13, 8). Our Lord Himself
explains the meaning of this parable (Matt. 13, 18-23).
The triple crown ascribed to St. John is probably that
referred to in the preceding stanza, viz„ that of martyr,
bennit, and prophet. Note the following:

Some crowns with glory thirtyfold are shining:
Others, a double flower and fruit combining:
Thy trinal chaplet bears an intertwining
Hundredfold fruitage.
-H. Τ. Henry.

3. “Now rendered powerful by thy rich merits, pluck
out the stony hardness of our hearts, make plain the rough
way, and make straight the crooked paths.'' (Of. Luke
3'‡·'54“)SO that the loving Creator and Redeemer of the
world, coming, may becomingly condescend to direct His
bles's’ed footsteps into our hearts free from all stain of
81115.. “With songs of praise let the heavenly citizens extol
Thee, God, One and Three3 suppliantly we pray for
pardon: spare Thy redeemed ones.''
