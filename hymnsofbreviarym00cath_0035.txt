METERS

quantitative and the rhythmical principles. These writers
made use of the simplest of all the lyric meters, the Iambic
Dimeter‚ with its regular succession of short and long syl-
lables; but they took care that the accents should in general
fall on the long syllables. Their quantitative hymns can
therefore be read rhythmically. In the composition of his
hymns, St. Ambrose did not make use of any greater licenses
than did Horace and his contemporaries. *Later on, how-
ever, it is noticeable that less and less attention was paid to
quantity and greater attention to accent Which began to re-
place it. As early as the fifth century many hymn-writers
employed the rhythmica] principle only. This process con-
tinued until in the Middle Ages all sense of long and short
syllables had vanished‚ and hymns were written in accen-
tual‚ non-quantitative meters. In studying the hymns
chronologically, it will be observed also that the growth of
rhyme kept pace with the growth of accent.

The scales given below illustrate the common quantitative
forms of the various meters employed in the composition of
Latin hymns. In non-quantitative Latin hymns, and in
English hymns, accent marks may be substituted for the
marks indicating the long syllables.

Scale ⁶·A” Iamblc Dimeter

Te lucis ante terminum, Before the ending of the day,

Rerum Creator poscimus, Creator of the world, we pray

Ut pro tua clementia That with Thy wonted favor Thou

Sis praesul et custodia. Wouldst be our Guard and Keeper
now.

In this meter a spondee or an anapest may be used in the
first and third foot. By far the greater part of the Breviary
hymns are composed in this meter. In English this is the
well-known Long Meter (L. M.) exemplified above.
