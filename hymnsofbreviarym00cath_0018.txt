PREFACE

Protestants should have issued so many volumes 01 11311313-
tion, history, commentary and appreciation 01 0111 Latin
hymnody, and should have exhausted the language of
eulogy in appraisal 01 1116 masterpieces—the Dies I ναὶ, the
Stabat Mater, the Lauda Sion, the Golden Sequence‚ and
the like. Charles Warren found sufficient matter in the his-
tory and the translations 01 1116 Dies I νώ 101 a. good-sized
volume. Dr. Coles, an American physician, gave a volume
to the Stabat Mater. Judge N oyes unostentatiously issued
his Seven Great Hymus of the Mcdz'oeval Clzureh, and the
book 1311 through many editions. The name 01 Protestant
editors and translators 01 our Latin hymns 13 legion. One
01 1116 111031 63111631 and reverent students 01 Latin hymn-
ody, and perhaps the most 16110110113 01 311 1116 113113131013,
was an Anglican clergyman, the Rev. J. M. Neale, D.D.
The distinction achieved by Father Britt in the present
volume, however, does 1101 116 111 1116 1301 11131 116 has ven-
tured‚ with catholieity 01 111613157 13316, 10 include render—
ings by other than Catholic pens. Orby Shipley in his
Annus Sanctus and the Marquess of Bute in his Roman
Breviary had already drawn a sharp contrast—the former
excluding, the latter including, non-Catholic renderings.
But the present compiler has, more largely than any other,
given representation 10 non-Catholio pens. He has mainly
sought 101 translations that should best combine a just
literalness with the just freedom in phrase and form 30-
corded by literary canons in the art 01 translation. There
is obvious danger, 011 1116 0116 hand, that the ray 01 (1001111131
1111111 will suffer 16113011011 when it passes from the medium
01 1116 Latin idiom into the medium 01 1116 English tongue.
On the other hand, there is danger that excessive devotion
to literalness in phrase rather than in thought will issue
in idiomatio awkwardness‚ questionable rhyming, stilted or
crabbed rhythm.

While the work 01 Father Britt derives distinction from
this largeness of view in selection, it also aims to secure
elegant artistry in the translation of our wonderfully rich
hymnody. The task is trying beyond ordinary apprehen-
sion, 101 1116 editor must minutely weigh questions 01 30-
01113057 111 1116 rendering, must measure relative felicities 01
