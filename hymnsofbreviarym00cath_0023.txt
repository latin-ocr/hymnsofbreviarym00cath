AUTHOR'S PREFACE

liberty was taken in the selection of English Doxologies.
The number of English translations is given under each
hymn. The number of translations credited to a hymn is
based in great part on the versions mentioned in Julian's
Dictionary of Hymnoloyy and in Duffield’s Latin Hymn-
Writers. To these lists have been added several recent
translations. All such lists are necessarily incomplete.

The editor is not unconscious of the many shortcomings
and imperfections of the present volume3 but if it will serve
to enkindle in the hearts of beginners, especially of young
men studying for the priesthood, a love for the hymns of
Holy Ohurch, it will have accomplished the chief purpose
for which it was undertaken. Its preparation has been both
a pastime and a labor of love. The result is cheerfully snb-
mitted to the judgment and correction of the proper eccles-
iastical authorities. The pointing out of any inaccuracies
will be duly acknowledged and greatly appreciated by the
editor.
