THE HOLY NAME

3. “O ,Iesus the hope of penitents, how kind art Thou
to those who pray! How good to those who seek Thee!
But what to those who find!'' This question is answered
in the following stanza.

4. “No tongue ean tell, nor can written word express it:
only one who knows from experienee ean say what it means
to love Jesus.''

5. “Mayest Thou, O Jesus, be our joy, as Thou wilt be
our reward: in Thee be our glory forever.”

44 Jesu Rex admirabilis
ESU Rex admirabilis, O JESU, King most wonderful
Et triumphator nobilis, Thou conqueror renowned,
Dulcedo ineffabilis, Thou sweetness most ineffable,
Totus desiderabilis. In whom all joys are found!
'Quando cor nostrum visitas, When once Thou visitest the beart,
Tunc lucet ei veritas, Then truth begins to shine;
Mundi vilescit vanitas, Then earthly vanities depart3
Et intus fervet caritas. Then kindles love divine.
'Jesu dulcedo cordium, Ο Jesu, light of all below,
Fons vivus, lumen mentium, Thou fount of lise and fire,
Excedens omne gaudium, Surpassing all the joys we know,
Et omne desiderium. And all we can desire:
‘Jesum omnes agnoscite, May every heart confess Thy
Amorem ejus poscite: Name,
Jesum ardenter quaerite, And ever Thee adore3
Quaerendo inardescite. And, seeking Thee, itself inflame

To seek Thee more and more.

'Te nostra Jesu vox sonet, Thee may our tongues forever
Nostri te mores exprimant, bless3

Te corda nostra diligant, Thee may we love alone;

Et nunc, et in perpetuum. And ever in our lives express

The image of Thine own.
