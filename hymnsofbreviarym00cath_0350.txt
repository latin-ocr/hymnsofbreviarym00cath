Won 'bright trophies of good, glad
be the voice ye raise,

While these heroes of Christ ye

sing!

They, while yet in the world were
by the world abhorred;

Felt how fading the joys, fleeting
the wealth it stored;

Spurned all pleasure for Thee, and
at Thy eall, O Lord‚

Came forth strong in Thy Name,
as King.

Bowed low, patient and meets,
loving the Lord so well,

Turned they still to the Christ,
their Friend.
