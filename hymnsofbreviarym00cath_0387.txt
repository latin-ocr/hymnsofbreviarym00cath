TRANSLATORS OF THE HYMNS

Neale's translations; two, however, easily obtained, are
especially deserving of note3 viz., the Rev. G. R. Wood-
ward's So‘nys of Syow, and the Rev. G. H. Palmer⁷s The
Hymner. The latter book, so we are told in the Prefaoe,
contains “translations of all, save two, of the Hymns from
the Sarum Breviary . . . Of the total number nearly
one-half are from the pen of the late Dr. J. M. Neale, of
whose vigorous and soholarly renderings the editor has
gladly availed himself.'' N eale's translations are from the
Original Text, not from the Roman Breviary Text.
