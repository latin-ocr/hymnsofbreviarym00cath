PROPER OF SAINTS

Te Martina tamen dans gladius Till smitten by the sword at length
neci she goes
Coeli coetibus inserit. To her immortal crown.

³Te, thuris redolens ara vapori· Now with the Saints Martina

bus, reigns in bliss,

Quae fumat, precihus jugiter in· And where Idolatry sat throned
vocat, of yore,

Et falsum peritnens auspicium, From her victorious altar praise
tui and prayer

Delet nominis omine. With odorous incense soar.

4Α nobis abigas lubrica gaudia, Expel false worldly joys; and fill

Tu, qui Martyribus dexter ades, us, Lord,
Deus With Thy irradiating beam divine;
Une et Trine: tuis da famulis Who with Thy suffering Martyrs
jubar, present art,
Quo clemens animos beas. Great Godhead one and trine.

This is a continuation of the preceding hymn. TRANS—
LATION by Father Caswall.

1. “N either the agonizing hook, nor wild beasts, nor the
rods with their painful wounds shake her constancy3 there-
upon Angels descend from the abodes of the Blessed and
strengthen her with heavenly food.’' Unyulw, a claw-
shaped torturing hook.

2. “And even the lion, laying aside his savage nature,
with friendly gaping jaws lays himself down at her feet:
thee, at length, Martina, the sword delivers up to death
and enrolls thee among the hosts of heaven.'' St. Martina
was beheaded in 228, in the persecution under Alexander
Severus.

3. “The altar which smokes, redolent with the odors of
incense, unceasingly invokes thee with prayers, and it de-
stroys and annihilates by the omen of thy name baneful
idol-worship.'' Auspicium, divination by means of birds.
The word is here used in the sense of idolatry, heathen wor-
ship in general. Omine.- The “omen'' alluded to is a refer-
ence to the derivation of the Saint's name Martina (the
warlike) from Mars, Martis, the god of war. The “war-
fare’' she waged was on the idols in the vicinity of Rome,
many of whose altars were overthrown by her prayers.
