THE MOST PRECIOUS BLOOD OF OUR
LORD JESUS CHRIST

FESTIVIS resonent compita

vocibus,

Cives laetitiam frontibus ex-
plicent,

Taedis flammiferis ordine pro·
deant

Instructi pueri et senes.

²Quem dura moriens Christus in

arbore

Fudit multiplici vulnere San-
guinem,

Nos facti memores dum colimus,
decet

Saltem fundere lacrymas.

⁸Humano generi pernicies gravis
Adami veteris crimine contigit:
Adami integritas et pietas novi
Vitam reddidit omnibus.

‘Clamorem validum summus ab
aethere
Languentis Geniti si Pater
audiit,
Placari potius sanguine debuit,
Et nobis veniam dare.

⁵Hoc quicumque stolam sanguine
proluit,

Abstergit maculas, et roseum
decus,

Quo fiat similis protinus Angelis:

Et Regi placeat, capit.

F estivis resonent

WITH glad and joyous strains

now let each street resound,
And let the laurel wreath each

Christian brow entwine;
With torches waving bright, let

old and young go forth,
And swell the train in solemn line.

Whilst we with bitter tears, with
sighs and grief profound,

Wail o’er the saving Blood, poured
forth upon the Tree,

Oh, deeply let us muse, and count
the heavy price,

Which Christ hath paid to make

us free.

The primal man of old, who fell
by serpent’s guile,
Brought death and many woes
upon his fallen race3
But our New Adam, Christ, new

life unto us gave,
And brought to all ne’er-ending
grace.

To heaven’s highest height, the
wailing cry went up

Of Him, who hung in pain, God's
own eternal Son;

His saving, priceless Blood, His
Father’s wrath appeased,

And for His sons full pardon won.

Whoe’er in that pure Blood his
guilty soul shall wash,

Shall from his stains be freed—
be made as roses bright—

Shall vie with Angels pure, shall
please his King and Lord,

And precious shine in His glad
sight.
