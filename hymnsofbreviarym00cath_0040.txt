INTRODUCTION

twelve hours of the day?'' (John 11, 9). They also (as did
the Jews after the conquest) divided the day into four
greater hours, and the night into four watches (custodite,
vzffl'lioe, noctes) each of which was of three common hours'
duration. As the hours or watohes of the Roman day and
night were based on solar time, they varied in length with
the season of the year. The season of the equinox is uni-
formly taken as the standard. At that time the duration of
day and night being equal, the hours and watches were
also equal. The following Tables illustrate the greater di· .
visions of the Roman day and night, and a oomparison
with Table “A'' will show' how the Churoh adopted the
ancient Roman subdivisions of the day and night as times

of prayer.

Table ⁴¹0 '⁹ Roman D1visions οἰ tlte Night

The First Watch‚ “evening,” was from 6:00 P. M. to 9:00 P. M. (our timo)
The Second Watch‚ “midnight‚” was from 9:00 P. M. to 12:00 P. M. (our time)
The Third Watch‚ “cock-crowing‚'’ was from 12:00 P. M. to 3:00 A. M. (our time)
The Fourth Watch‚ “morning‚” was from 3:00 A. M. to 6:00 A. M. (our time)

These hours and watches are frequently mentioned in
the N ew Testament. In a single verse St. Mark refers to
the four watches. “You know not when the lord of the
house cometh3 at even, or at midsnz‘yht, or at the cocle-crow-
iny, or in the mornin9'’ (xm, 35). The Gatholio Encyclo-
pedia contains instructive articles on each of the canonieal
lffurs3 there is also an article on Brevioery, and one on

octums.
