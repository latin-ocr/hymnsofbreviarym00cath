illustrious band of converts whose conversion is traced
directly to the Tractarian Movement. Mr. Shipley was
an hymnologist of great ability and his compilation, the
Annus Sanctus is repeatedly referred to in this volume.
He is also the editor of the Carmina Mariana, and other
collections now out of print. He edited the MSS. of Robert
Campbell, and of the Very Rev. Prior Aylward, O.P.‚ and
included many of their finest translations in his Annus
Sanctus (Burns, Oates a VVashbourne, London).

Benedictine Order and was afterwards known by his re—

he translated 311 the hymns of the Breviary and Missal.
Several of his translations are in Mr. Shipley's Annus

WOODWARD, REV. GEORGE RATOLIFF, MA.
(b. 1848), was educated at Harrow, and at Gonville and
