STE Confessor Domini colentes
Quem pie laudant populi per
orbem:
Hac die laetus meruit beatas
Scandere sedes.

²Qui pius, prudens, humilis,
pudicus,
sobriam duxit sine labe vitam,
Donec humanos animavit aurae
Spiritus artus;

³Cujus ob praestans meritum
frequenter,
AEgrabquae passim jacuere mem·
ra
Viribus n’aorbi domitis, saluti
Restituuntur.

‘Noster hinc illi chorus obsequen-
Concign laudem, celebresque
palmas3
Ut piis ejus precibus juvemur
Omne per aevum.

Iste Confessor

HIS the Confessor of the Lord‚
whose triumph
Now all the faithful celebrate,
with gladness
Erst on this feast-day merited to
enter
Into his glory.

Saintly and prudent, modest in
behavior

Peaceful and so‘ber, chaste was he,
and lowly,

While that life’s vigor, coursing
through his members‚
Quickened his being.

Sick ones of old time, to his tomb

resorfing,

Sorely by ailments manifold
affiicted‚

Ost-times have welcomed health

and strength returning,
At his petition.

Whence we in chorus gladly do
him honor,

Chanting his praises with devout
affection,

That in his merits we may have a
portion,
Now and forever.
