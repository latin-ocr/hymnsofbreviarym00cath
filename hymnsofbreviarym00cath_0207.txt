METER: Troohaio tetrameter catalectio. TRANSLATION by
Father Edward F. Garesohe, Εὖ. There are ten transla-
tions. This beautiful little hymn was formerly sung at the
Elevation of the Host in Mass. It is not found in the

1. “Hail‚ true Body, born of the Virgin Mary, which
truly suffered and was immolated on the Oross for man;
whose pieroed side streamed with Water and With Blood.
Be Thou to us a foretaste (of heaven) When we are in the
agony of death. O clement, O loving, O sweet Jesus, Son

of Mary.’'
