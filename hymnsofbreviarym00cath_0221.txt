DIES IRAE

entreaty, impart a grandeur and dignity to the Dies Irce
which are unique in this kind of writing. Then the wonder-
ful adaptation of the triple rhyme to the theme—like blow
following blow of hammer upon auvil, as Daniel says—im-
presses every reader'' (Latin Hysmozss, p. 249).

Scriptural references: The hymn is replete with Scrip-
tural references to both the Old and N ew Testaments. The
actual Judgment scene will be found in detail in Matt. 24,
27-31; Luke 21, 25-273 Apoc. 20, 12-15.

Analysis: (a) The first six stanzas are descriptive. They
picture with remarkable brevity and detail the Judgment
scene of the Scriptures.

(b) The remaining stanzas are lyric in character and ex-
press the anguish of one of the multitude there present in
spirit—his pleading before the ι1111180, who, while on earth,
sought him unceasingly over the hard and thorny ways
from Bethlehem to Calvary ; and now, in anticipation of the
Judgment, pleads before a Saviour of infinite mercy, who,
on Judgment Day, will be a Judge of infinite justice, be-
fore whom scarcely the just will be secure.

(0) The seventh stanza serves to connect the descrip-
tive with the lyric part of the hymn. In it the soul acknowl-
edges the futility of expecting aicl from creatures—for even
the Saints and Angels will be judged.

(d) The eighth stanza represents Christ in the twofold
character of “King of awful majesty'' in the Last Judg-
ment, and “Fount of 10171118 piety’' in the present life.

(e) The next six stanzas (9-14) develop the thought of
God’s mercy. They comprise two divisions of three stanzas
each. The last stanza of each division contains an appro—
priate prayer. The first division (stanzas 9-11) deals with
the first basis on which an appeal for mercy may rest, viz„
on the labors and sufferings of Christ. The second division
(12-14) deals with the second basis on which an appeal for
mercy may rest, viz„ on the repentance of the sinner.

(f) In the fifteenth stanza the Scriptura] division of
the sheep (the just) from the goats (the reprobates) is set
before us: in the sixteenth stanza the picture of the ‹ludg—
ment is concluded with the “depart ye cursed‚'' and “come
ye blessed'' of the Scriptures.
