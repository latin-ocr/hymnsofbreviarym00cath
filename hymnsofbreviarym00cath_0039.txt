THE CANONICAL HOURS

Each of the first three lines of the Sapphic strophe con-
sists of a trochee, spondee, dactyl, and two trochees. The
last syllable may belong or short. The fourth line is Adonic,
and consists of a dactyl followed by a spondee. In the first
three lines the place for the caesura is generally after the
fifth syllable. See hymns: 7, 10, 96, 105, 106, 113, 114, 115,
121, 135, 160, 164. Most of these hymns are translated in
the meters, Sapphic and Adonic, of the originals.

THE CANONIGAL HoURs

The canonical hours are: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce,
Sext, None, Vespers and Compline. Matins is composed of
parts called Nocturns or Vigils, two or three in number.
Lauds was originally the concluding part of Matins. Even
now Matins and Lauds are scarcely ever separated. The
traditional view is that the Nocturns of Matins were recited
at different times during the night. Outside of monastic
communities, however, the observance of such nightly Vigils
would scarcely be possible.

There is in the Breviary a hymn assigned to each of the
canonical hours. Many of these hymns contain allusions
which are better understood in both the literal and sym-
bolical sense, when it is known at what particular part of
the day or night the hymn was formerly sung. The follow-
ing table will be found sufficiently accurate for all practica]

purposes.

In appointing these times for the recitation of the can-
onical hours, the Church had in mind the greater divisions
or hours of the Roman day. The Romans divided the day,
from sunrise to sunset, into twelve equal parts called
“hours.” These were the common hours. “Are there not
