Sanctorum meritis inclyta gaudia

Pangamus socii gestaque fortia:

Gliscens fert animus promere cantibus
Victorum genus optimum.

This strophe consists of three Asclepiadic lines and one
Glyconic. The above is a classical specimen of a hymn writ-
ten in this meter. See the translations of hymns 77, 136, 159.

There is some difference of opinion as to how the classical
Asclepiadic strophe should be read. This question is dis-
cussed in the article on this hymn in the cath. Enoycl. How-
ever, the majority of those who read these hymns in the
Breviary, read them rhythmically as if written in dactyle.
This is well exemplified in another article in the same work
on the hymn Sacris solemniis—a hymn written in accentual,
non—quantitative measuresz

Lo! the Angelic Bread feedeth the sons of men:

F igures and types are fled never to come again.

O what a wondrous thing! lowly and poor are fed,
Banqueting on their Lord and King.

Hymns: 77, 92, 93, 94, 104, 118, 131, 136, 159.

Ecce jam noctis tenuatur umbra,

Lux et aurorae rutilans coruscat:

Supplices rerum Dominum canora
Voce precemur.

Lo! the dim shadows of the night arc waning;
Lightsome and blushing‚ dawn of day returnethg
Fervent in spirit, to the mighty F ather

Pray we devoutly.
