VESPERS HYMNS OF THE PSALTER

The theme, or subject matter, of the Vespers hymns for
the week is the work of the six days of creation as

recorded in the first chapter of Genesis. The Saturday
hymn, which is a hymn in honor of the Most Holy Trinity,
forms the only exception. The work of each of the six
days is explained in the article on Heoeoemerorz, in the cath.
Encycl.

The authorship of these six hymns is not definitely
known. The series develops in an orderly manner the work
of creation, devoting four stanzas to the work of each day.
There is strong probability that these hymns are the work
of one and the same author, and that that author is no
other than the illustrious Pope and Doctor of the Ohurch,
St. Gregory the Great (540-604). In this connection it 13 111-
teresting to record 1113 opinion of the editors of the care-
131157 edited Historicaz Editio-n of H ymas Ancient and Mod-
ern (1909) z “The set,'' in their opinion, “must have come
from one author, and it is not improbable that that author
was St. Gregory’' (p. 21). And again: a The series as a
whole is probably rightly identified with a set of hymns for
every evening in the week, which Irish records describe as
having been sent by St. Gregory to 81. Columba. The ancient
preface to Columba's hymn Altus prosator describes the
coming of 81. Gregory's messengers with gffts, including a
set of hymns for the evenings of the week, and the sending
by 81. Columba of his hymns to 81. Gregory in return. The
series 13 not unworthy of such an author, and the hymns
go far to justify the tradition that ascribes to that most
versatile of popes a place among the Hymn-writers” (p.
XVII). See 3130 1113 3111313 on H ymnody, by Father
Clemens Blume, S.J., in the cath. Encycl„ Vol. VII„ p. 602.

The Benedictine editors of the works of St. Gregory
credit him with eight hymns (Opera, Paris, 1705); Η. A.
Daniel in his Thesaurus Hymnl. Vol. I, assigns him three
others. The Lucis Creator optime given below is one of the
eight hymns assigned him by the Benedictine editors.

The translations of these hymns in Part I of Mr. Orby
Shipley's Annus Sanctus are from the Primer of 1706, and
