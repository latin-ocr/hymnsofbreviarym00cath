COMMON OF SAINTS

Plaude, cinis meus, est tua pars
Deus3 ejus es et sis;

Rex tuus est tua portia, tu sua;
ne sibi desis.

1C breve vivitur, hic breve
plangitu13 hic breve fletur3

Non breve vivere, non breve
plaudere, retribuetur.

stat brevis actio,

vita perennis3
O retributio! coelica mansio stat
lue plenis.

O retributio!

Sunt modo proelia, postmodo
praemia,--qualia? plena:

Plena refectio, nullaque passio,
nullaque poena.

Spe modo vivitur, et Sion angitur
a Babylone3

Nunc tribulatio, tunc recreatio,
sceptra, coronae.

Qui modo creditur, ipse videbitur
atque scietur,

Ipse videntibus atque scientibus
attribuetur.

Mane videbitur, umbra fugabitur,
ordo patebit;

Mane nitens erit, et bona qui gerit,
ille nitebit.

Nunc tihi tristia, tunc tibi
gaudia,—gaudia, quanta

Vox nequit edere, lumina cernere,
tangere planta.

Pars mea, rex meus, in proprio
Deus ipse decore

Visus amabitur, atque videbitur
auctor in ore.

Exult, O dust and ashes,
The Lord shall be thy part,
His only, His forever
Thou shalt be and thou art.

Hic breve vivitur

BRIEF life is here our portiom

Brief sorrow, short-lived care;
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is there.

Ο happy retribution!

Short toil, eternal rest3

For mortals and for sinners
A mansion with the blest!

And now we fight the battle,
But then shall wear the crown
Of full and everlasting

And passionless renown;

And now we watch and struggle,
And now we live in hope,

And Sion in her anguish

With Babylon must cope3

But He whom now we trust in
Shall then be seen and known3
And they that know and see Him
Shall have Him for their own.

The morning shall awaken, ¹
The shadows shall decay,
And each true-hearted servant

Shall shine as doth the day.

There grief is turned to pleasure,
Such pleasure as below

No human voice can utter,

No human heart can know.

There God, our King and Portion,
In fulness of His grace,

Shall we behold forever,
And worship face to face.
