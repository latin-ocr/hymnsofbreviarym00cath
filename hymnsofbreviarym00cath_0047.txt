5 Te lucis ante terminum
E lucis ante terminum, BEFORE the ending of the day,
Rerum Creator poscimus, Creator of the world, we pray
Ut pro tua clementia That with Thy wonted favor Thou
Sis praesul et custodia. Wouldst be our Guard and Keeper

²Procul recedant somnia, From all ill dreams defend our
Et noctium phantasmata; eyes,
Hostemque nostrum comprime, From nightly fears and fantasies;
Ne polluantur corpora. Tread under foot our ghostly foe,

That no pollution we may know·

³Praesta, Pater piissime, O F ather, that we ask be done,

Patrique compar Unice, Through Jesus Christ, Thine only
Cum Spiritu Paraclito Son;
Regnans per onme saeculum. Who, Ἤξζιε the Holy Ghoet and

Doth live and reign eternally.
