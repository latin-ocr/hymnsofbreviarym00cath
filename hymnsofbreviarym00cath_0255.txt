GIOAL Use: Hymn for Lauds on the Feast of the Seven Holy
Founders.

1. “The Fathers spent their lives in obscurity‚—yet
as seven lilies of snow—white beauty they seemed to Peter
to shine—well pleasing to the Vir-gin high exalted.'' Petro:
St. Peter of Verona saw in a vision a mountain covered
with fiowers, among which were seven lilies, dazzling white,
of exquisite persume. Mary herself explained the vision-
the flowers were the Religious on Mount Senario, the seven
lilies were the Seven Founders.

2. “And now divine charity impelling them, they tra-
verse 1111163 and wander everywhere, if perehanee they
might be able to fix the Sorrows of the Mother 111 1116 souls
of all.’' ’

3. “By this means they are able 10 restrain blind pas-
sions; they unite (in the bonds of love) fieroe hearts igno-
rant of peace3 the words of the pious preachers raise up
the dejected and recall sinners.'’

4. “At last the Virgin leading forth her servants ae-
eompanies them 10 1116 heavenly regions, and with jeweled
garlands she adorns her servants forever blessed.''

5. “O may they now hear the sighs of those assembled
in prayer3 may they behold their difficult labors3 and may
they with leving inspirations be favorable 100111· prayers.''

103 Matris sub almae
ATRIS sub almae numine BY Mary’s inspiration led,
Septena proles nascitur: A sevenfold offspring eomes
Ipsa vocante, ad arduum to light3
Tendit Senari verticem. At Mary’s call away they sped

To Mount Senario's rugged height.
