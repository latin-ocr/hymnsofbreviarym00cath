Iambic dimeter. TRANSLAmoN by J. M. Neale. There are

Sext daily throughout the year. Sext was said at noon.
The great heat of the noonday sun is compared to the heat
of the passions which we beseech God to extinguish. We
implore Him also to grant us health of body and peace of
soul. Read the separate articles on this hymn and on Sext,
in the Cath. Encyel.

1. “O mighty Ruler, truthful God, who dost regulate the
changes of things, with splendor dost Thou light up the
morning, and With burning heat the noonday, ' ' V eraoe Deus.-
Est autem Deus verax: omnis autern homo mendax, siout
scriptum est (Rom. 3, 4). Splendore: “Splendor'’ is here
the beauteous, beneficent light of the morning, in contra-
distinction to the sweltering heat of midday.

2. “Extinguish Thou the flames of strife, remove harm-
ful heat, grant health of body and true peace of heart.'’
Litium.- N oli contendere verbis (II Tim. 2, 14). Calorem

. noxium: evil desires. Pacem cordium.- Pacem relinquo

vobis, pacem meam do vobis; non quomodo mundus dat,
ego do vobis. Non turbetur eor vestrum, neque formidet

(John 14, 27).

Immotus in te permanens, holding all creation,

Lucis diurnae tempora Who ever dost Thyself unmoved

Yet day by day the light in due
