PASSIONTIDE

⁵Vagit infans inter arcta
Conditus praesepia:
Membra pannis involuta
Virgo Mater alligatt
Et Dei manus pedesque
Stricta cingit fascia.

⁶Lustra sex qui jam peregit,
Tempus implens corporis,
Sponte libera Redemptor
Passioni deditus,
Agnus in Crucis levatur
Immolandus stipite.

⁷F elle potus ecce languet:
Spina, clavi, lancea
Mite corpus perforarunt:
Unda manat, et cruor:

Terra, pontus, astra, mundus,

Quo lavantur flumine!

⁸Crux fidelis, inter omnes
&egrtfflanngfiffls ’prof ert
Fronde, flore, germine:
Dulce ferrum, dulce lignum,
Dulce pondus sustinent.

‘’Flecte ramos arbor alta,
Tensa laxa viscera,
Et rigor lentescat ille,
Quem dedit nativitas;
Et superni membra regis
Tende miti stipite.

¹⁰ Sola digna tu fuisti
Ferre mundi victimam3
Atque portum praeparare
Arca mundo naufrago,
Quam sacer cruor perunxit,
Fusus Agni corpore.

Weeps the Infant in the manger
That in Bethlehem’s stable stands;

And His limbs the Virgin Mother
Doth compose in swaddling hands,

Meetly thus in linen folding
Of her God the feet and hands.

Thirty years among us dwelling‚

His appointed time fulfilled‚

Born for this, He meets His
Passion,

For that this He freely willed:

On the Cross the Lamb is listed,

Where His life-blood shall be
spilled.

He endured the nails, the spitting‚

vinegar, and spear‚ and reed3

From that holy Body broken

Blood and water forth proceed:

Earth‚ and stars, and sky, and
ocean,

By that flood from stain are free.

Faithful Cross! above all other,
One and only noble Tree!

None in foliage, none in blossom‚
None in fruit thy peers may be;
Sweetest Wood and sweetest Iron!
Sweetest Weight is hung on thee.

Bend thy boughs, O Tree of glory!
Thy relaxing sinews bend;

For awhile the ancient rigor,
That thy birth bestowed, suspend3
And the King of heavenly beauty
On thy bosom gently tend!

Thou alone wast counted worthy
This world's ransom to uphold;
For a shipwrecked race preparing
Harbor, like the Ark of old3
With the sacred Blood anointed
From the smitten lamb that rolled.
