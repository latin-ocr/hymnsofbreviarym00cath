THE SEVEN DOLORS OF OUR LADY

‘Cunctis interea stat generosior Yet thou with patient mien
Virgo Martyribus: prodigio Beneath His Cross dost stand,
novo, Nobler in this, I ween,

In tantis moriens non moreris Than all the martyr-band:
Parens, A thousand deaths‚ O Qucen,
Diris fixa doloribus. Upon thy spirit lie,

Yet thou, Ο marvel! dost not die.

“Sit summae Triadi gloria, laus, Ο Holy Trinity,
honor, Let earth and heaven raise

A qua suppliciter, sollicita prece, Their song of laud to Thee

Posco virginei roboris aemulas The while my spirit prays: --

Vires rebus in asperis. When evil comes to me,
The strength do Thou imp art
That elrstg upheld Thy Mother’ s

cart!
