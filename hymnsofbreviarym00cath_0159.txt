2. “Who as Creator, ⁴when the world was made, didst be-
stow upon Adam the image of Thy countenance, and didst
yoke a noble spirit with the slime of the earth.'' lunayo:
Faciamus hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram

limo terrae, et inspiravit in faciem ejus spiraculum vitae, et
factus est homo in animam viventem (Gen. 2, 7).

3. “When the envy and deception of the devil had disfig-
ured the human race, Thou, the Maker, clothed in fiesh
didst restore the lost form.’' Formam, beauty. Livor Ξ
invidia, envy, malice.

4. “As Thou wast once born of a Virgin, so art Thou
now born from the tomb; and Thou dost bid us buried with
Thee, to arise from the dead.'' (cf. Rom. 6, 4.)

5. “Thou art the eternal Shepherd who dost cleanse Thy
flock in the waters of Baptism: that is the laver of souls,
that is the sepulcher of sin.’' The purification of the soul
by washing is a common figure in the Old Testament.
Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea: et a peccato meo munda
me (Ps. 50, 4).

6. “As Redeemer fastened to the Cross, which was long
our due, Thou didst lavishly give Thy Blood as the price
of our salvation.” Debitoe agrees with crum} on account of
our sins, the Cross (1.6., crucifixion) was long and justly due
us.

7. “That Thou, O Jesus, mayest be an everlasting
Paschal joy to our hearts, deliver us re-born to life, from a

dire death of sin.’'
