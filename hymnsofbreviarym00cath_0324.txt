Amnon: Pope Urban VIII (1568-1644). Marna: Iambic
dimeter. TRANSLATION by D. J. Donahoe. There are four
translations. LITURGIOAL Usu: Hymn for Vespers and
Matins. St. Teresa (1515-1582) was an illustrious mem-
ber of the Carmelite Order. A brief account of her won-
derful life is given in the cath. Encycl„ and a more ex-
tended biography in Butler's Lives of the Saints. Note the
spelling: Teresa, Teresia, Theresa.

1. “As a herald of the heavenly King, thou dost leave,
O Teresa, thy father’s house to give to barbarous lands
either Christ or thy blood.” As a mere child, Teresa and
her little brother actually set out for the country of the
Moors, with the hope of dying for their saith. Much to
their disappointment they were intercepted by an uncle
and restored to their distracted mother.

2. “But a sweeter death awaits thee, a more delightful
pain claims thee: pierced even unto being wounded by a
shaft of divine love, thou dost fall.'’ This stanza refers
to the Transverberation of the Saint’s heart. In her auto·
biography she tells us that an Angel appeared to her, and—-
“He had in his hand a long golden dart, and at the end of
the point methought there was a little fire; and I con-
ceived that he thrust it several times through my heart and
after such a manner that it passed through my very bow-
els3 and when he drew it out, methought it pulled them
out with it, and left me wholly inflamed with a great love
of God'' (Butler's Lives). Her body is still preserved
incorrupt at Alba in Spain, and “her heart, too, showing
the marks of the Transverberation is exposed there for the
veneration of the faithful'’ (Cam. Eumol). There is an
Office and Mass in honor of the Tramsverberatio Cordis S.
Teresioe (Aug. 27).
