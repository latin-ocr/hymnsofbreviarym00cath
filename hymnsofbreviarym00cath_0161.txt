dimeter. TRANSLATION by Robert Campbell. LITURGIOAL
Usa: Hymn at Lauds from Low Sunday to the Asoension.
In its complete form this hymn eomprises forty-four lines.
For Breviary use it is divided into three parts. These
parts are given here as Hymns 62, 63 and 64. In each
hymn the stanza beginning Tu sis perennis mentium and
the doxology form no part of the original hymn. The
hymn was greatly altered by the revisers under Urban
VIII (1632). The first lines of the three parts of the
Original Text and of the Roman Breviary Text are as
follows:

Roman Breviary T'ext Original Text
62 Aurora coelum purpurat Aurora lucis rutilat
63 Tristes erant Apostoli Tristes erant Apostoli
64 Paschale mundo gaudium Claro Paschali gaudio

Including both textS, there are twenty-seven translations
of No. 623 there are about fifteen translations each of the
Nos. 63 and 64. The Aemus Sanctus contains four transla-
tions, one of which is from the Original Text. It also oon-
tains two translations of Sermone blando amyotus, which be-
gins with the sixth stanza of the Original Text. There is an
article on Aurora lucis rutilat in the cath. Enoyel. It is
worthy of note that this is the only instance in the Oath.
