defilements of sin.’' ραεε, so. vita, from the preceding
stanza. Unda et sanquine.- An allusion to‚--sed unus mili-

&sig-acfsszlgl ils9fuglciiiled what David foretold in faithful song,
saying to the nations: ‘God has reigned from a. Tree.' '’
A liquo: “from the wood,’' or, “from a tree.'’ The
· reference is to Ps. 95, 10: Dicite in gentibus quia Dominus
regnavit a ligno. The words a Ziyno are not found in any
present text of the Scriptures. They were, however, fre· .
quently quoted by the early Fathers3 and St. Justin even
accused the Jews of having erased them from the Hebrew
text. If not a Scriptural, the a ligno is at least a liturgical
expression still in use during Pascha] time in the “Com-
memoration of the Cross,'' in both Lauds and Vespers.
“The words are probably a gloss by some early Christian
scribe, transferred, in course of time, from the margin into
the text'' (Rev. J. M'Swiney, S.J., in his Translwtion of
the Psalms and Camicles, p. 405). In this stanza, some
texts read cecinit for concinit, dicens for dicendo, and rey-
nabit for reynavit.

4. “O beautiful and resplendent Tree adorned with the
purple of the King, chosen to bea-1· on thy worthy trunk,
limbs so holy.’' Purpura, purple3 here, the Most Precious
Blood, Tanyere: to touch, come in contact with.

5. “O blessed Tree upon whose branches hung the
ransom of the world3 it was made the balance of the body,
and snatched away the (expected) prey of hell.’' The last
two lines are obscure, and are variously rendered. Pre-
tium: Empti enim estis pretio magno (I Cor. 6, 20).
Statera, 111., a steelyard3 a balance, beam, scales3 also the
value of a thing, price. “Statera corporis, the payment of
the body having been made3 others read facta est: many
read statera saeculi, the price of the world'' (March's
Latin Hymns, p. 254). The following translations are
good:

“The price of human-kind to pay,

And spoil the spoiler of his pray.” N l
