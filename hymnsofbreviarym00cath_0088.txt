THE PSALTER

Dixit autem Deus: Fiant luminaria in firmamento coeli, et
dividant diem ac noctem, et sint in signa et tempora, et dies
et annos: ut luceant in firmamento coeli, et illuminent
terram. Et factum est ita. Fecitque Deus duo luminaria
magna: luminare majus, ut praeesset diei: et luminare
minus, ut praeesset nocti: et stellas. Et posuit eas in firma-
mento coeli, ut lucerent super terram, et praeessent diei ac
nocti, et dividerent lucem ac tenebras. Et vidit Deus quod
esset bonum. Et factum est vespere et mane dies quartus.

1. “Most Holy Grod of heaven, Thou dost adorn with fiery
brilliancy the lightsome regions of the universe, and dost
embellish them with becoming splendor :'' The light created
on the first day was a vast, luminous, nebulous mass, which
contracted and solidified on the fourth day, thus forming
the sun and the stars. These heavenly bodies constitute the
“lightsome regions’' of the universe.

2. “Thou, on· tlie fourth day didst light up the fiery disk
of the sun, didst appoint the orbit of the moon, and the wan-
dering courses of the stars‚''

3. “ That Thou mightest give to nights and days a bound-
ary-line of separation, and a conspicuous sign for the begin-
ning of the months.'' The boundary line between night and
day-darkness and daylight—-is indicated by the sun, the
moon, and by the morning and evening stars. The new
moon announces the beginning of the lunar mouth.

4. “Drive out the darkness from our hearts3 wipe away
the defilements of our souls; loosen the chains of guilt;

overturn the great load of our sins.''
