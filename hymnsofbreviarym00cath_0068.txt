THE PSALTER

³Jesum ciamus vocibus, Lord‚ to Thee we lift on high
Flentes, precantes, sobrii: Fervent prayer and bitter cry:
Intenta supplicatio Hearts aroused to pray and sigh
Dormire cor mundum vetat. May not slumber more:

⁴ Tu, Christe, somnum discute: Break the sleep of Death and Time,
Tu rumpe noetis vincula: Forged by Adam's ancient crirne;
Tu solve peccatum vetus, And the light of Eden’s prime
Novumque lumen ingere. To the world restore!

⁵Deo Patri sit gloria, Unto God the Father, Son,
Eiusque soli Filio, Holy Spirit, Three in One,
Cum Spiritu Paraclito One in Three, be glory done,
Nunc et per omne saeculum. Now and evermore.

Auernos: Prudentius (348-413). Merene Iambio dimeter.
TRANSLATION by W. J. Courthope. There are twelve trans-
lations. This hymn is a cento from the Η ymn wt Goek-Grow,
the first of the twelve hymns of the Cathemerinon of
Prudentius. There are twenty-five four-line stanzas in the
Hymn at C'ock-Crow. The Ales diei nuntius is composed os
stanzas 1, 2, 21, and 25 of the complete hymn. This hymn
affords a fair, but by no means an extreme, illustration of
the manner in whieh centos have been taken from the hymns
of Prudentius for Breviary use..

The hymns for Lauds on Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday are from the Cathemerinon. It will be observed
that they are replete with figurative expressions. As dark-
ness and mists are symbolieal of sin and unbelief‚ so light
is a symbol of truth and of Christ. In studying these three
hymns, attention should be paid to the figurative, rather
than to the literal meaning of their lines. Mr. Oourthope’s
spirited translations preserve much of the spirit and beauty
of the originals. In these translations the following stanza
immediately precedes the doxology. It is not a translation
of any part of the Latin text:

Now before Thy throne, while we
Ask, upon our bended knee,
That this blessing granted be,
And Thy grace implore;

The above note applies equally to hymns 14, 16, and 18.
