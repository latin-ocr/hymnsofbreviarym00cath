tion to all Christians to offer sacrifices of praise to Christ,
the true Paschal Lamb, the Sinless One, who by His immola-
tion on the Cross reconciles sinuers to His Father. Death
and Life engage in a. most unusual combat3 the Princo of
Life dies, but by His very death He triumphs and now
reigns in glory. The second part is in the form of a dialogue.
Mary Magdalene is appealed to as a witness of the Resur-
rection, and she testifies :—“I saw the sepulcher of the liv-
ing Christ, the glory of the risen Lord, the witness-angels
at the tomb, the napkin and the winding-sheet.'' Then in
an ecstasy of joy she proclaims to the Apostles: “Christ my
hope is risen and He shall go before you into Galilee.'' It
concludes with a. testimonial of our belief in the Resurrec-
tion and with a petition for mercy. The history of the
Resurrection is told in John 203 read also the beginning of
Matt. 283 Mark 16; Luke 24.

less One hath reconciled sinners to His Father.'’

3. “Death and Life contended in a wondrous encounter:

4. “Tell us, Mary, what sawest thou on the way? I saw
the sepulcher of the living Christ, I saw the glory of Him
that had risen.’'

cloths. Christ, my hope, hath risen: He shall go before you

into Galilee.''

dead: Thou, O victorious King, have mercy on us.'’ Vic-

The following is Robert Campbell's translation of the
Victimae Paschali. Note the striking difference between this
translation and Miss Leeson’s translation above. The dif-
ference is due to the meter. The two translations illustrate
the hurried pace of the trochee and the stately tread of the

iambus.
