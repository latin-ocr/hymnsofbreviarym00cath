COMMON OF SAINTS

and Lauds. This beautiful hymn is founded on Is. 28, 5;
Cantiele of Cantieles 2, 163 Apoe. 14, 4.

1. “O ιΪ88118, erown of Virgins‚ whom that Mother eon-
eeived who alone as Virgin did give birth to a child, graei-
ously accept these our prayers.''

2. “Thou walkest among the lilies surrounded by ehoirs
of Virgins, as a bridegroom adorned with glory dispensing
gifts to brides.’' Peryis: The Original Text has pascis-
which text Neale translates. The texts differ but slightly.
Qui pascitur inter lilia (Cant. 2, 16). The lily is a sym-
bol of virginal purity; it is here used for Virgins them-
selves.

3. “Whithersoever Thou goest, Virgins follow, and with
songs of praise they hasten after Thee, causing sweet
hymns to resound.''

4. “We suppliantly beseeeh Thee that Thou grant to our
senses that they may know nothing whatever of all the
wounds of corruption.'’ Addas Ξ des, tribuas. Sensibus,
to our souls. Nescire, to have nothing to do with.

164 Virginis Proles

VIRGINIS Proles, opifexque SON of a Virgin, Maker of Thy
Matris, Mother‚

Virgo quem gessit, peperitque Thou, Rod and Blossom from a
Virgo; Stem umtainfed,

Now while a Virgin fair of fame
we honor,
Hear our devotion!

Virginis festum canimus beatae,
Accipe votum.

²Haec enim palmae duplicis beata
Sorte, dum gestit fragilem
domare
Corporis sexum, domuit cruen-
tum
Caede tyrannum.

⁸Unde nec mortem, nec amica
mortis

Mille poenarum genera expave-
scens,

Lo, on Thy handmaid fell a two-
sold blessing,
Who, in her body vanquishing the
weakness,
In that same body, grace from
heaven obtaining,
Bore the world witness.

Death‚ nor the rending pains of
death appalled her;
Bondage and torment found her

undefeated:
