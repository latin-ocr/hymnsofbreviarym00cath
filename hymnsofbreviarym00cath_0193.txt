CORPUS CHRISTI

4Ῑῐι hac mensa novi Regis,
Novum Pascha novae legis,
Phase vetus terminat.
Vetustatem novitas,
Umbram fugat veritas,
Noctem lux eliminat.

⁵Quod in coena Christus gessit,
Faciendum hoc expressit
In sui memoriam.
Docti sacris institutis,
Panem, vinum in salutis
Consecramus hostiam.

⁶Dogma datur Christianis,
Quod in carnem transit panis,
Et vinum in sanguinem.

Quod non capis, quod non vides,

Animosa firmat fides,
Praeter rerum ordinem.

⁷Sub diversis speciebus,

Signis tantum, et non rebus,
Latent res eximiae.

Caro cibus, sanguis potus:

Manet tamen Christus totus,
Sub utraque specie.

⁸A sumente non concisus,
Non confractus, non divisus:
Integer accipitur.
Sumit unus, sumunt mille:
Quantum isti, tantum ille:
Nec sumptus consumitur.

At the new King's sacred table,
The new Law's new Pasch is able
To succeed the ancient Rite:

Old to new its place hath given,
Truth has far the shadows driven,
Darkness flees before the Light.

And as He bath done and planned

lt—
“Do this”-—hear His love com-
mand it,

“For a memory of me.'’
Learnffl, Lord, in Thy own
science,
Bread and wine, in sweet com·

pliance,
As a Host we offer Thee.

Thus in saith the Christian
heareth:

That Christ’s Flesh as bread ap-
peareth,

And as wine His Precious
Blood:

Though we feel it not nor see it,
Living Faith that doth decree it
All gffieofgcts of sense makes

Lo! heneath the species dual
(Sigus not things), is hid a jewel
Far beyond creation’s reach!
Though His Flesh as food

abideth‚
And His Blood as drink—-He
hideth
Undivided under each.

Whoso eateth It can never
Break the Body, rend or sever3
Christ entire our hearts doth
Thousands eat the
Heaven,
Yet as much to one is given:
Christ, though caten, hideth
still.
