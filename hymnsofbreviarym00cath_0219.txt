There are, or rather were, in 1895, some 234 recorded Eng-
lish translations of this world—famous hymn. There are
four translations in Mr. Shipley’s Annus Sanctus. LITUR-
GIOAL Usu: Sequence in Requiem Masses. It is very prob-
able that the Dies Irae was composed as a sequence for the
first Sunday in Advent.

The exquisite beauty of the Latin original has continu-
ally lured translators to attempt to reproduce this noble
hymn in the vernacular. The great number of the trans-
lations is an eloquent witness of this fact. It is freely ac-
knowledged that no adequate translation has yet appeared.
Dr. Coles, a Newark physician, who made eighteen trans-
lations of the hymn, maintains that no single version can
refiect the totality of the original. The untranslatableness
of the hymn is acknowledged by the Rev. Mr. Duffield,
whose sixth version, in his opinion, has not carried him
“one inch’' beyond the first.

Some idea of the difficulties that confront the translator
may be obtained from the following apoloyia of Dr. Coles
for having made so many versions z—“To preserve, in con-
nection with the utmost fidelity and strictness of rendering,
all the rhythmic merits of the Latin original,—to attain
to a vital likeness as well as to an exact literalness, at the
same time that nothing is sacrificed of its musical sonorous-
ness and billowy grandeur, easy and graceful in its swing
as the ocean on its bed,—to make the verbal copy, other-
wise cold and dead, glow with the fire of lyric passion,—
to refiect, and that too by means of a single version, the
manifold aspects of the many-sided original, exhausting at
once its wonderful fulness and pregnancy,—to cause the
white light of the primitive so to pass through the medium
of another language as that it shall undergo no refraction
whatever,-—-would be desirable, certainly, were it prac-
ticable3 but so much as this it were unreasonable to ex-
pect in a single version” (Dies Iroe in Thirteen Oriyz‘nal
Versions, p. 33).
