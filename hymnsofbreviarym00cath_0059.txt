SUNDAY AT LAUDS

⁸Tu lux refulge sensibus, Shed through our hearts Thy
Mentisque somnum discute: piercing ray,
Te nostra vox primum sonet, Our souls’ dull slumber drive
Et vota solvamus tibi. away:

Thy Name be first on every

To Thee οἱ earliest praises sung.

⁹ Deo Patri sit gloria, All laud to God the Father be,

Ejusque soli Filio, All praise, Eternal Son, to Thee,
Cum Spiritu Paraclito, All glory, as is ever meet,
Nunc, et per omne saeculum. To God the holy Paraclete.

TRANSLATION by W. J. Copeland as altered in The H ymner.
There are eighteen translations. LITURGICAL Usn: Hymn for
Lauds on Sunday from the Ootave of the Epiphany until the
first Sunday of Lent, and from the Sunday nearest the
Calends of Oetober until Advent. The AEterne rerum Con-

—light‚ star, moon, light of a lamp, eto. The meaning seems
to be that the orowing of the eook serves for the nocturnal
traveler as a lamp, a kindly guide to the habitations of men.
A nocte noctem: ηοω is here used in the sense of watch-—a
fourth part of the night. The eock by his erowing, at mid-
