Usa: Hymn for None daily throughout the year. N one, or
the Ninth Hour (3:00 P. M.), corresponds to the hour of
Our Lord's death. In this hymn we acknowledge the omni-
potence and providence of G0d3 and we ask that eternal
glory be the reward of a holy death. Read the separate ar-
ticles on N owe and on this Hymn, in the Cath. Encycl. The
meter, iambic pentameter, in the above beautiful transla—
tion is unusual in the translation of Latin hymns.

in Thyself dost remain unmoved, and dost determine our
times by successive changes of the light of day:'' I namatus,
unchanged. Tempora: The regular divisions of time as
marked off by the progress of the sun in the heavens. Suc-
cessus, progress, advance‚ a succession of time.

2. “Bestow Thou upon us Thy light in the evening (of
life), that life may never fail us, but that eternal glory
may await us as the reward of a holy death.'' Laryire‚
imper. of largior. Lumen, the light of glory.
