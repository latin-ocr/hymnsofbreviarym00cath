CORPUS CHRISTI

the reality, of future good things promised (cf. Heb. 10,
1-19). The principal types mentioned in the hymns are:

(a) The Paschal Lamb (Exod. 12). The Paschal Lamb
is the most expressive type or figure of Christ mentioned
in the Old Testament. It was slain the day before the
Passover3 it was to be without blemish3 it was to be offered
to God and then eaten; not a bone of it was to be broken3
its blood sprinkled on the door—posts of the Israelites pre-
served them from temporal death, as Christ's Blood shed
on the Cross preserves us from eternal death. It might also
be noted that a lamb is remarkable for its gentleness; it
submits to unmerited suffering without complaint (Is. 53,
73 Acts 8, 32) ; in the Old Law it was slain for sins not its
own3 Christ is the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins
of the world (cf. John 1, 29-36) ; He is the Lamb which was
slain from the beginning of the world (Apoc. 13, 8), i.e.,
in the foreknowledge of God.

(b) Manna: (Exod. 16). Manna was the miraculous
bread of the Israelites during their forty years' sojourn in
the desert; it came down from heaven every morning, and
it was consumed in the morning3 it was small and white3
and such was its nature that “neither had he more that had
gathered more, nor did he find less that had provided less'’
(Exod. 16, 18).

(c) Isaac (Gen. 22). Isaac was a type of Christ in that
he was the well beloved and only—begotten son of his father
Abraham3 He carried on his shoulders the wood on which
he was to be sacrificed3 he was an obedient· and willing
victim3 his life, as recorded in Gen. 15-35, pictures him as
pre-eminently a man of peace, whose willing sacrifice on
Mount Moria was typica] of the greater Sacrifice on Mount
Calvary.

. (d) Azymes (Exod. 12-13). The azyme-bread was un-
leavened bread prescribed by the Mosaic Law for the Feast
of the Passover. There was also a Feast of the Azymes
(of the Unleavened Bread) which continued for seven days.
The Azymes and Passover were practically one and the
same feast. Unleavened bread is a type of sincerity, truth,
moral integrity‚ exemption from the corrupting leaven of

sin, etc. (cf. Ι Cor. 5, 8).
