MANY MARTYRS

Armata saevit ungulis Against them, armed with ruthless
Tortoris insani manus. brand
And hooks of steel, their torturers
stand.
*Nudata pendent viscera: The mangled frame is tortured
Sanguis sacratus funditur: sore,
Sed permanent immobiles The holy life-drops freshly pour;
Vitae perennis gratia. They stand unmoved amidst the
strife‚

By grace of everlasting life.

⁵Te nunc Redemptor quaesumus, Redeemer, hear us of Thy love,

Ut Martyrum consortio That‚ with the Martyr host above,
Jungas precantes servulos Hereafter‚ of Thine endless grace,
In sempiterna saecula. Thy servants also may have place.

Aornos: St. Ambrose (340-397). METER: Iambic dimeter.
