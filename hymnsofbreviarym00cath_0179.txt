WHITSUNTIDE

⁷Deo Patri sit gloria, To God the Father, laud end
Et Filio, qui a mortuis pmise,

Surrexit, ac Paraclsto, Praise to the Son be given3

In saeculorum saecula. Praise to the spirit of all grace,

The fount of graces seven—-

As was of old, all worlds before,

Is now and shall be evermore,

When time and change are spent
and o’er—

All praise in earth and heaven.
