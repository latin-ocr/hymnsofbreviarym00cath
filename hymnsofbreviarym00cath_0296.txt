from the eyes of men. The Breviary thus records the
miracle of the roses referred to in this stanza: “In the
depth of winter she changed the money she was going to
distribute to the poor into roses to conceal it from the
king.'' Almsdeeds and the prayers of the faithful are

125 Pater superni luminis

PATER superni luminis, FATHER of lights! one glauce

Cum Magdalenam respicis, of Thine,
Flammas amoris excitas, Whose eyes the universe control,
Geluque solvis pectoris. F ills Magdalene with holy love,
And melts the ice withjn her soul.

²Amore currit saucia Her precious ointment forth she
Pedes beatos ungere, brings
Lavare fletu, tergere Upon those sacred feet to pour;
Comis, et ore lambere. She washes them with burning
tears,
And with her hair she wipes them
o’er.
’Adstare non timet Cruci, Impassioned‚ to the Cross she
Sepulchro inhaeret anxia: clings,
Truces nec horret milites, Nor fears beside the tomb to stay3
Pellit timorem caritas. Nor dreads the soldiers’ savage

mien
F or love heis cast all sear away.

40 vera, Christe, caritas, Ο Christ, Thou very Love itself!

Tu nostra purga crimina, Blest hope of man, through Thee
Tu corda reple gratia, forgiven! -
Tu redde coeli praemia. So touch our spirits from above,

So purify our souls for heaven.
