SS. PETER AND PAUL

considerably altered by the revisers under Pope Urban
VIII, in 1632. Including both texts there are at least
twelve translations. The complete hymn consists of six
stanzas, including the doxology. The order of the stanzas
in the complete hymn is as follows: Decora lux3 Mundi
magister3 Beate Pastor Petre3 Egregie Doctor Paule; O
Roma felix3 Sit Trinitati. Note the use made of parts of
this hymn on the Feasts of St. Peter’s Chair (hymn 90),
and of the Conversion of St. Paul (hymn 91).

1. “The beauteous Light of Eternity hath flooded with
blissful fires this golden day which crowns the Princes- of
the Apostles, and opens unto the guilty a free way to
heaven.’' God is “the beauteous Light of Eternity.'’ The
“blessed fires'' are His graces and blessings. The
“golden day'' is the festival of the two Apostles.

2. “The teacher of the world, and the door—keeper of
heaven, fathers of Rome, and judges of the nations, the
one triumphant over death by the sword, the other by the
Oross3 now laurel-crowned they sit in the assembly of
eternal life.” Mundi Magister, St. Paul (Cf. Rom. 11, 13) ;
Ooelz· Jamtor, St. Peter (Of. Matt. 16, 19). Arbitri, judges
(Of. Matt. 19, 28). Constr.: Ille (Paulus) victor per necem
ensis, hic (Petrus) per necem crucis possident laureati
senatum vitae.

3. “O happy Rome, who art consecrated by the glorious
blood of two Princes3 empurpled by the blood of these, thou
alone dost surpass all other beauties of the world.''

4. “To the Trinity in Unity that doth govern all
throughout eternity‚ be endless glory, honor, power, and
jubilation. ’ '

Aperire terris coelum‚ apertum To men below, and power to shut
claudere. them fast again.
