PROPER OF THE SEASON

In labore requies, Rest in labor, coolness sweet,

In aestu temperies, Tempering the burning heat,

In fletu solatium. Truest comfort of our woes.
3Ο lux beatissima, Ο divinest light, impart

Reple cordis intima Unto every faithful heart
Tuorum fidelium. Plenteous streams from love's
Sine tuo numine, bright flood.

Nihil est in homine, But for Thy blest Deity,

Nihil est innoxium. Nothing pure in man could be;

Nothing harmless, nothing good.

*Lava quod est sordidum, Wash away each sinful stain;
Riga quod est aridum, Gently shed Thy gracious rain
Sana quod est saucium. On the dry and fruitless soul.
Flecte quod est rigidum, Heal each wound and bend each
Fove quod est frigidum, will,

Rege quod est devium. Warm our hearts benumbed and

chill,

All our wayward steps control.

⁶Da tuis fidelibus, Unto all Thy faithful just,
In te confidentibus, Who in Thee confide and trust,
Sacrum septenarium. Deign the sevenfold gift to send.
Da virtutis meritum, Grant us virtue's blest increase,
Da salutis exitum, Grant a death of hope and peace,
Da perenne gaudium. Grant the joys that never end.

dieval times the Veni Sancte Spiritus was known as “The
Golden Sequenee.'' In 1110 opinion of erities it is justly re-
garded as one of the greatest masterpieees of sacred Latin
poetry. Treneh considers 11 1110 loveliest of all the hymns in
the whole circle of sacred Latin poetry‚ and adds that it
could only have been composed by one who had been ac-
quainted with many sorrows, and also with many consola-
