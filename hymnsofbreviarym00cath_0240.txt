Ο sola quae casto potes Him,

Cum lacte donans oscula. Whose breast gave milk to Iesus,

Whose arms thy God embraced;

⁸Tuque ex vetustis patribus And thou of all men chosen
Delecte custos Virginis, To guard the Virgin’s fame,
Dulci patris quem nomine To whom God’s Son refused not
Divina Proles invocat. A Father’s gracious name;

‘De' stirpe Jesse nobili Born for the nation’s healing,
Nati in salutem gentium, Of Jesse’s lineage high,
Audite nos qui supplices Behold the suppliants kneeling,
Vestras ad aras sistimus. O hear the sinners’ cry!
⁸Dum sol redux ad vesperum . The sun returned to evening,
Rebus nitorem detrahit, Dusks all the twilight air:
Nos hic manentes intimo We, lingering here before you,
Ex corde vota fundimus. Pour out our heartfelt prayer.
