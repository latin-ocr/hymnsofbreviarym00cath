ST. JOSEPH ’

²0 nimis felix, nimis o beatus,
Cujus extremam vigiles ad horam
Christus et Virgo simul astiterunt
Ore sereno.

³Hinc stygis victor, laqueo solutus
Carnis, ad sedes placido sopore
Migrat aeternas, rutilisque cingit
Tempora sertis.

⁴‘Ergo regnantem flagitemus om·
nes
Adsit ut nobis, veniamque nostris
obtinens culpis‚ tribuat supernae
Munera pacis.

“Sint tibi plausus, tibi sint
honores,

Trine, qui regnas, Deus, et
coronas

Aureas servo tribuis fideli
Omne per aevum.

O blest beyond the lot of mortal
O’er wllssesrglaet dying sigh
Christ and the Virgin-Mother
watched serene,
Soothing his agony.

Loosed from his fleshly chain,
gently he fleets,

As in calm sleep, away3

And diademed with light, enters
the seats
Of everlasting day.

There throned in power, let us
his loving aid
With fervent prayers implore;
So may he gain us pardon in our
Antileepieace forevermore.

Glory and praise to Thee, blest
Trinity!
One only God and Lord,
Who to Thy faithful ones un·
failingly
Their aureoles dost award.
