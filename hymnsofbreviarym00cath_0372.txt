COMMON OF SAINTS

Nescio, nescio, quae jubilatio, lux
tibi qualis,

Quam socialia gaudia, gloria quam
specialis.

Sunt Sion atria conjubilantia,
martyre plena,

Cive micantia, principe stantia,
luce serena.

Sunt ihi pascua mentibus afflua
praestita sanctis3

Regis ibi thronus, agminis et sonus
est epulantis.

Gens duce splendida, contio can-
dida vestibus albis,

Sunt sine fletibus in Sion aedibus,
aedibus almis.

I know not, O I know not
What joys await us there,
What radiancy of glory,
What light beyond compare.

They stand, those halls of Sion,
conjubilant with song,

And bright with many an Angel,
And all the Martyr throng;

The Prince is ever in them,
ΤῙιε daylight is serene,

The pastures of the blessed.
Are decked in glorious sheen.

There is the throne of David3
And there, from care released,
The song of them that triumph,
The shout of them that feast3

And they who with their Leader
Have conquered in the fight,

F orever and forever

Are clad in robes of white.
