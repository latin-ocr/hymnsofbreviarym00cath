PROPER OF SAINTS

Father's glory (Of. Heb. 1, 3). This line was borrowed by
the compilers of the cento in 1568, and was retained by
the revisere under Urban VIII, 1632. It is the first line of

Hymn 12.

THE SEVEN DOLORS OF OUR LADY

SEPT. 15

131

JAM toto subitus vesper eat
polo,

Et sol attonitum praecipitet diem,

Dum saevae recolo ludibrium
necis,

Divinamque catastrophen.

² Spectatrix aderas supplicio
Parens,
Malis uda, gerens cor adaman-

tinum:
Natus funerea pendulus in cruce
Altos dum gemitus dabat.

⁸Pendens ante oculos Natus,

atrocibus

Sectusb verberibus, Natus hianti·
us

F ossus vulneribus, quot pene-
trantibus

Te confixit aculeis!
⁴Heu! sputa, alapae, verbera,
vulnera,

Clavi, fel, aloe, spongia, lancea,

Sitis, spina, cruor, quam varia
pium

Cor pressere tyrannide!

J am toto subitus

NOW let the darkling eve

Mount suddenly on high,
The sun affrighted reave
His splendors from the sky,
While I in silence grieve
O’er the mocked agony
And the divine catastrophe.

Gries-drenched, thou dost appear
With heart of adamant,

O Mother3 and dost hear

The Great Hierophant,

Upon His wooden bier

Locked in the arms of Death‚

Utter in groans His parting hreath.

What lookest thou upon,
Mangled ancl bruised and torn?
Ah, ’tis the very Son

Thy yearning breast hath borne!
Surely‚ each breaking rnoan

And each deep-mouthed wound
Its fellow in thy heart hath found!

Surely‚ the taunts and woes,

The scourge, the dripping thorn,

The spitting and the blows‚

The gall, the lance, the scorn—

Surely, each torment throws

A poison-dart at thee, ‚

Crushed by their manifold
tyranny.
