TE DEUM

divine assistance and guidanee3 a declaration of our
fidelity; a prayer for deliveranoe from sin during the day
(about to begin); it oloses with a prayer for meroy for
those who have hoped in the Lord.

In the following N otes, the numbers refer to the verses
of the Te Deum:

5. Sanctus.- The “Tersanotus'' is found in both the Old
Testamenta (Is. 6, 3) and in the New (Apoe. 4, 8). Supply
eS, art Thou.

7. Apostolorum.- Note the climax: the small number of
Apostles, the greater number of Prophets, the white-robed
army of Martyrs, the Churoh throughout the world.

9. Martyrum.- Only Martyrs were venerated in the early
Chureh. The first non-Martyrs venerated in the West were
Pope St. Sylvester (d. 335) and St. Martin of Tours (d.
397). Candidatus, white-robed. The Blessed in general are
represented as elothed with white robes (ef. Apoo. 7, 9-14).

14. Rex yloriae: David in propheoy referring to the ascen·
sion of the Messias styles Him “the King of Glory'' (Ps.
23, 7-10). The whole Psalm is very beautiful.

16. Hominem z naturam humanam. This verse does not
lend itself readily to translation. The difficulty is with the
proper rendering of suscepturus hominem: (some texts
have suscepisti, but this is immaterial). Since the Primer
of 1546, translations like the following have found their
way into most of our books of devotion 2—“'1'h0u, having
taken upon Thee to deliver man''; “When Thou tookest
upon ,Thee to deliver man.'’ It is needless to say that suoh
renderings mean something quite different from the fol-
lowing : “Thou, when about to take upon Thea man (i.e‚
human nature) to liberate the human raoe, didst not abhor
the Virgin's womb.'' After liberandum some supply
mundum, others homimem, men, the human raee. H orruisti,
variously rendered—sear, abhor, disdain, shrink from, ete.

17. Mortis aculeo: (of. I Cor. 15, 55-56).

18. Dexteram Dei: a figurative expression signifying the
place of highest honor, power, and glory in heaven (Ps. 109,
13 Mark 16, 19). Sedes: sittest‚ i.e., abidest‚ remainest. This
implies no particular posture of body.

19. Crederis, passive, Thou art believed.
