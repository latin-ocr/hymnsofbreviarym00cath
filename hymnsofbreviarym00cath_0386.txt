TRANSLATORS OF THE HYMNS

LEESON, JANE ELIZABETH (1807-1882). Of Miss
Leeson’s personal history nothing is known. She pub-
lished several books of hymns, especially for children. Her
widely used translation of the Victimae Paschali first ap-
peared in Father Formby's Catholic Hymws, 1851. Miss
Leeson, the editor has been informed, was a devout Oatholic.
Hymn: 59.

LITTLEDALE, REV. RIGHARD FREDERICK, B.A.,
LL.D. (1833-1890), was educated at Trinity College, Dublin,

Professor of poetry in the Catholic University of Dublin. ⁷

By his incomparable version of Calderon, “the Spanish
Shakespeare,'' he has won a permanent place in English
letters. He was an ardent patriot and a devout Catholic.
Hymn: 57.

MODOUGALL, ALAN G„ was born in 1895, and was re-
ceived into the Ohurch in 1919. He resides in London.
Mr. McDougall is the author of Panye Linquor—a collection
of Breviary hymns of old use, with English metrical trans-
lations. The translations are exceptionally good and they
rank among the most felicitous in the language. They are
“equal to N eale’s at his best’' is the opinion of no less an
authority than Mr. J ames Britten. This is high praise but
it is not unmerited. The volume contains a scholarly thirty-
page introduction by Dr. Adrian Fortescue. Panye Linyua
is published by Burns, Oates and Washbourne, 22 Orchard
St„ London, and it is a beautiful specimen of the book-
maker’s art. Hymns: 1, 64, 77, 105, 129, 136, 138, 155.

NEALE, REV. JOHN MASON, D.D. (1818-1866) was
educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Dr. Neale was
an eminent hymnologist and a most felicitous translator
of Greek and Latin hymns. His translations of Latin
hymns appeared in his Mediaeval Hymns and Semcences,
1851, and in the H ymnal N oted, 1852 and 1854, in which 94
out of the 105 hymns therein are translated from the Latin
by Dr. Neale. Most modern hymnals contain some of
