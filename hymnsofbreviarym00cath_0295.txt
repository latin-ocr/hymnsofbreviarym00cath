ICHES and regal throne, for
Christ’s dear sake,
True Saint‚ thou didst despise;
Amid the Angels seated now in
Oh, helllglzss, from the skies!

Guide us; and fill our days with
perfume sweet

Of loving word and deed;

So teaches us thy beauteous

By fragrant roses hid.

saeculum:

Tibique laus perennis alme Son
Spiritus. And spirit, evermore.

salvation3 we will follow: O may there be but one mind
among the faithful, may every aetion be a good odor! The
charity concealed by thy roses betokens this.'’ St. Eliza-

she always endeavored to conceal her eharitable deeds
