AUTHORS OF THE HYMNS

Contractus, the crippled. Despite his physica] defects, he
entered the school of St. Gall in his seventh year, and
quickly mastered Greek, Latin, Arabio, history, music,
mathematics‚ philosophy, and theology. He was one of the
most learned men of his time. At the age of thirty he
entered the Benedictine monastery of Reichenau, where he
became Abbot and spent the remainder of his days.
Hymns: 30, 33.

HILARY, ST. (d. 368). Bishop, Confessor, and Doctor
of the Church. He was born at Poitiers of heathen
parents3 and it was in his native city that he was elected
Bishop. As Bishop, his strenuous opposition to the Arian
heresy earned him the title of Malleus mimorum—“The
Hammer of the Arians.’' His hostility to the Arians
caused him to be exiled to the distant coasts of Phrygia.
Many hymns have been ascribed to St. Hilary, most of
which are of doubtful authenticity. In 1887, a fragment of
St. Hilary's Liber Hymnorum was discovered. This con-
tains three hymns or parts of hymns which can with rea-
sonable certainty be ascribed to him. Hymn 70 has often
been ascribed to him, but on insufficient evidence.

INNOOENT III, POPE (1161-1216) was born at Anagni
in Italy. He was one of the most learned theologians and
jurists of his time. During his active reign, which lasted
eighteen years, the Papacy reached the zenith of its power
and influence. Hymn: 67.

INNOOENT VI, POPE (d. 1362) was born at Mont in
France. He attained eminence as a professor of civil law
at Toulouse. As Pope he was actuated by lofty ideals and
did much to reform abuses. Hymn: 80.

JAOOPONE DA TODI (or Jacobus de Benedictis) was
born at Todi in Italy early in the thirteenth century, and
died at an advanced age in 1306. He studied law, probably
at Bologna, and for some years he followed the profession
of advocate. About 1278 he entered the Franciscan Order,
in which, out of humility‚ he chose to remain a simple lay
brother till the end of his life. Hymns: 54, 55, 56, 57.

LEO XIII, POPE' (1810-1903) was born at Oarpineto in
Italy. He was Nuncio to Brussels, and for thirty-two years
