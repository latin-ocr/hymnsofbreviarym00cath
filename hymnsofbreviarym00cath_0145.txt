sifier‚’' Denis Florenee MacCarthy. Mr. MaoCarthy's
translations of both hymns are in the Annus Sanctus.

1. “The sorrowful Mother stood weeping beside the
Cross, while her Son hung thereon: a sword piereed her
sighing, compassionate, and grief—stricken soul.'' Stabat.-
Stabant autem juxta erucem Jesu mater ejus, eto. (John
19, 25). Pertrcmsivz't yladius: Et tuam ipsius animam per-
transibit gladius (Luke 2, 35). Read the beautiful Cantiole
of Simeon (Luke 2, 29-32). The sword of Simeon's
propheoy‚ which was to pieree the soul of the Mother, was
the sword of grief that transfixed her as she stood beside
the Cross on Calvary. Mary is the “Sorrowful Mother‚''
and her Divine Son is the “Man of Sorrows'’ (Is. 53 3).

2. “O how sad and how afflioted was that Blessed Mother
of the Only-Begotten! How she grieved and suffered, that
loving Mother, when she beheld the pains of her glorious
Son.'’

3. “Who is there that would not weep, if he should be-
hold the Mother of Christ in suoh great distress? Who
would be able not to grieve, if he should contemplate the
Mother of Christ suffering with her Son⁰.2” Constr.: Quis
posset non contristari. Contemplarz' = si contemplaretur.

4. “For the sins of His own nation, she saw J esus in tor-

dying, abandoned, until He yielded up the ghost.'' Pro
peccatis suoe yemis.- Ipse enim salvum faciet populum suum
a peccatis eorum (Matt. 1, 21). For a history of the Pas-
sion of Our Lord, ef. Matt. 26-273 Mark 14-153 Luke 22-233
John 18-19. Emisit spiritum: ‚J esus autem iterum olamans .
voce magna, emisit spiritum (Matt. 27, 50).

5. “Ah, Mother, fount of love, make me feel the force of
grief, make me weep with thee. Make my heart burn with
the love of Christ, my God, that I may be pleasing to Him.''
Sibi, for ei or ipsi. This use of the pronouns is quite oom-
mon in Late Latin and in the Vulgate; e. g.‚ Matt. 16, 21;
Mark 10, 323 Gen. 2, 18; Tobias 3, 11.

6. “Holy Mother, mayest thou bring it to pass, that the
wounds of the Crucified may be deeply stamped upon my
