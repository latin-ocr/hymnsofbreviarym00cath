HISTORICAL

HE use of hymns in the Western Church dates
from the fourth century, from the days of the
two illustrious Doctors of the Ohurch, SS.
Hilary and Ambrose. The first in point of

which bear his name are the compositions of later writers.
In 1887, three fragments of hymns from St. Hilary's Liber
Hymnorum were discovered; these are probably the only
genuine hymns of St. Hilary that have survived.

this purpose he chose with remarkable judgment a simple
strophe consisting of four iambic dimeters—four lines of
eight syllables each. This, which is the simplest of all the
