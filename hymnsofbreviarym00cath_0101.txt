34 Τ he Great Antiphons of Advent

The seven Great Antiphons‚ or Ο Antiphons‚ as they are
called, are said, one each day, at the Magnificat in Vespere,
from December the 17 th to the 23d, inclusive. Although not
written in meter, they are strikingly poetica] in thought,
and replete with Scriptural allusions. Each Antiphon sa-
lutes the coming Messias under one of His many Scrip-
tural titles‚ and closes with a proper petition. The au-
thorship and date of composition are unknown. They are,
however, at least as old as the ninth century, and probably
much older. There are several translations in both prose
and verse. Mr. Shipley's Annus Sanctus contains a metri-
cal version by H. N. Oxenham. Read the articles on the

Ο Antiphons, and on Admmt, in the Cath. Encycl.
