Perducis ad coelestia: boasts‚

Who leadest to celestial day
Those who have cast earth’s joys

²Aurem benignam protinus Thine ear in mercy, Saviour, leud,

Intende nostris vocibus: While unto Thee our prayers
Trophaea saera pangimus: ascend3

Ignosce quod deliquimus. And as we count their triumphs

won
F orgive the’sins that we have done.

In sempiterna saecula. All glory‚ as is ever meet,
