4 Praecepta quorum protinus Sickness and health your voice
Languor salusque sentiunt: obey3
Sanate mentes languidas; At your command they go or stay:
Augete nos virtutibus. From sin’s disease our souls
restore;
In good confirm us more and
more.
⁵ Ut, cum redibit arbiter So when the world is at its end,
In fine Christus saeculi, And Christ to judgment shall
Nos sempiterni gaudii descend,
Concedat esse compotes. May we be called those joys to

Preparggefrom all eternity.

‘'Patri, simulque Filio, Praise to the F ather with the Son,
Tibique sancte Spiritus, And Holy Spirit, Three in One;
Sicut fuit, sit jugiter As ever was in ag es past,
Saeclum per omne gloria. And so shall be while ages last.
