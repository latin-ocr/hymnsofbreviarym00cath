PROPER OF THE SEASON

to the manna of old, which was a type of the Manna of the
N ew Law. Et pluit illis manna ad manducandum, et panem

coeli dedit eis.

Panem angelorum manducavit homo:

cibaria misit eis in abundantia (Ps. 77, 24-25).

7. “O triune Deity, we beseech Thee, that Thou visit us,
as we adore Thee3 lead us by Thy ways, whither we direct
our steps, to the light wherein Thou dost dwell.''

'VERBUM supernum prodiens,

Nec Patris linquens dexte-
ram,
Ad opus suum exiens,
Venit ad vitae vesperam.

² In mortem a discipulo
Suis tradendus aemulis,
Prius in vitae ferculo
Se tradidit discipulis.

³Quibus sub bina specie
Carnem dedit et sanguinem3
Ut duplicis substantiae
Totum cibaret hominem.

4Se nascens dedit socium,
Convescens in edulium,
Se moriens in pretium,
Se regnans dat in praemium.

⁵0 salutaris hostia,

Quae coeli pandis ostium,
Bella premunt hostilia,

Da robur, fer auxilium.

‘Uni trinoque Domino,
Sit sempiterna gloria:
Qui vitam sine termino
Nobis donet in patria.

Verbum supernum prodiens

THE fHealy'nly Word proceeding
Yet leavlhtghot the F ather’s side,
And going to His work on earth

Had reached at length life’s

eventide.

By false disciple to be given

To foemen for His Blood athirst‚

Himself, the Living Bread from
Heaven,

He gave to His disciples first.

To them He gave, in two-sold kind,
His very F lesh, His very Blood:

In lovefs own fulness thus de-
Of the Svlghroilg man to be the food.

By birth, our fellow-man was He;
Our meat, while sitting at the
' board3

He died, our ransomer to be;

He ever migne, our great reward.

Ο saving Vicfim, opening wide

The gate of heaven to man below,
Our foes press on from every side,
Thine aid supply, Thy strength

bestow.

To Thy great Name be endless
Immortlalaglsddheass One in Three;
Ο grant us endless length of days
In our true native land, with Thee.
