168 Urbs Jerusalem beata

RBS Jerusalem beata,
Dicta pacis visio,
Quae construitur in coelis
Vivis ex lapidibus,
Et Angelis coronata,
Ut sponsata comite.

²Nova veniens e coelo,
Nuptiali thalamo,
Praeparata, ut sponsata
Copuletur Domino:
Plateae et muri ejus,
Ex auro purissimo.

³Portae nitent margaritis
Adytis patentibus3

Et virtute meritorum

Illuc introducitur

Omnis qui ob Christi nomen
Hic in mundo premitur.

⁴ Tunsionibus, pressuris
Expoliti lapides,
Suis coaptantur locis
Per manus artificis,
Disponuntur permansuri
Sacris aedificiis.

BLESSED City‚ heavenly Salem,

Vision dear of peace and love,
Who, of living stones upbuilded,
Art the joy of heaven above,
And, with Angel cohorts cimled,

As a Bride to earth dost move!

From celestial realms descending,

Ready for the nuptial bed,

To His presence, decked with
jewels,

By her Lord shall she be led:

All her streets and all her
bulwarks

Of pure gold are fashioned.

Bright with pearls her portal
glitters;

It is open evermore;

And, by virtue of His merits‚

Thither faithful souls may soar,

Who for Christ's dear Name in this
world

Pain and tribulation bore.

Many a blow and biting sculpture
Polished well those stones elect,
In their places now compacted
By the heavenly Architect,

Who therewith hath willed forever
That His palace should be decked.

169 Angularis fundamentum

⁵ NGULARIS fundamentum

Lapis Christus missus est,
Qui parietum compage
In utroque nectitur,
Quem Sion sancta suscepit,
In quo credens permanet.

⁶Omnis illa Deo sacra,
Et dilecta civitas,

HRIST is made the sure Foun-

dation‚
And the precious Corner-stone,
Who, the two walls underlying,
Bound in each, binds both in one,
Holy Sion’s help forever,
And her confidence alona

All that dedicated City‚
Dearly loved by God on high,
