WEDNESDAY AT MATINS

1. “The winged herald of the day proclaims the ap-
proaching light3 now Christ, the awakener of souls, calls
us to life.'’ The “winged messenger'' is the cock, who in
Christian symbolism is a symbol of early rising and vig-
ilance. Propinquam, approaching3 Lauds was said at day-
break, or cock-crow, the beginning of the morning watch.
E'oecz‘tator mentium.- Christ by His grace is the awakener of
souls.

2. “Take up your beds, He cries, ye who are slothful from
idle sleep, and watch ye, chaste, upright, and sober, for I
am at hand.” AEyro sopore: Ye who have become slothful
from idle, excessivo, sickness-producing sleep. Sobrii:
Sobrii estote et vigilate (I Peter 5, 8). Vigilate ergo, quia
nescitis qua hora Dominus vester venturus sit (Matt. 24, 42).

3. “Weeping, praying, and sober, let us, with our voices,
invoke Jesus: fervent prayer forbids the pure heart to
sleep.'’

4. “Do Thou, O Christ, dispel sleep, break the bonds of
night, free us from the sins of former days, and infuse new
light in us.''

Ad confitendum surgimus, Of those, who, rising to confess,
Morasque noctis rumpimus. Outstrip the lingering day.

Paulusque gestis censuit. As holy Psalmists give the word,

And hoyly Paul the deed.
