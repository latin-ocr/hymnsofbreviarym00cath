There is a pretty legend concerning the composition 01 11110
hymn. Theodulf, 00 111110 1110 legend, had for some politieal
reasons been imprisoned in a monastery in Angers. Dur-
ing his incarceration he wrote this hymn, whieh he sang
from the window 01 1110 0011 when the king, Leuis the Pious,
was passing in the procession on Palm Sunday in 821. The
hymn so moved the king that 110 immediately ordered that
the holy bishop be set at liberty and restored to his 000.
The legend 10 now discredited on 111010110οΙ grounds.

The hymn is based on the following passages 01 Scrip-
ture: Ps. 117, 25-263 Matt. 21, 1-163 Mark 11, 9-1ος Luke 19,
37 -383 John 12, 12-13. This is the only instance 01 1110 1100 01

dactylie hexameter and a so—ealled pentameter verse. The
latter is the same as the former except that it omits the last
half 01 1110 third 1001 and 01 1110 sixth 1001. Ι11 1110 following
