EGALI solio fortis Iberiae, LORY of Iberia’s throne!

Hermenegilde jubar, gloria J oy of martyred Saints above!
Martyrum, Who the crown of life have won
Christi quos amor almis Dying for their Saviour's love.
Coeli coetibus inserit.

²Ut perstas patiens, pollicitum What intrepid saith was thine!

Deo What unswerving constancy!
Servans obsequium! quo potius Bent to do the will divine
tibi With exact fidelity.

Nil proponis, et arces
Cautus noxia, quae placent.

⁸Ut motus cohibes, pabula qui Every rising motion checked

parant Which might lead thy heart astray,
Surgentis vitii, non dubios agens How thou didst thy course direct
Per vestigia gressus, Whither virtue showed the way.

Quo veri via dirigit!

Divinumque supremis
