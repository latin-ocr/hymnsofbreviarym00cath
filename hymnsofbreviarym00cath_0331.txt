ALL SAINTS

⁴Vos purpurati Martyres, Ye Martyrs all! a purple band,

Vos candidati praemio And Confessors, a white-robed
· Confessionis, exsules train3

Vocate nos in patriam. Oh, call us to our native land,

From this our exile, back again.

⁵Chorea casta Virginum, And ye, O choirs of Virgins

Et quos eremus incolas chaste!

Transmisit astris, coelitum Receive us to your seats on high;

Locate nos in sedibus. With Hermits whom the desert
waste

Sent up of old into the sky.

‘Auferte gentem perfidam Drive from the flock, O Spirit
Credentium de finibus, blest!
Ut unus omnes unicum The false and faithless race away;
Ovile nos pastor regat. That all within one fold may rest,
Secure beneath one Shepherd’s
sway.
⁷Deo Patri sit gloria, To God the Father glory be,
Natoque Patris unico, And to His sole-begotten Son;
Sancto simul Paraclito, And glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
In sempiterna saecula. While everlasting ages run.
