AUTHOR: Venantius Fortunatus (530-609). METER:
Iambic dimeter. TRANSLATION by W. Κ. Blount. There
are about sorty translations, ten of which are in Mr. Ship-
ley’s Annus Sanctus. According to Julian's Diot. of
Hymnoloyy the above translation, dating from 1670, is by
far the best rendering of the Vexilla Regis in common use;
while J. M. N eale’s translation, in various forms, is more
widely used than all others put together (p. 1221).
N eale's translation of the Original Text is in the Baltimore
Manual of Praye‘rs, p. 612. LITURGICAL Usa: Vespers hymn
from Passion Sunday to Wednesday of Holy Week. It
is also the Vespers hymn on the Feasts of the Finding (May
3) and of the Exaltation (Sept. 14) of the Holy Gross.
The Veoeilla Reyis was originally intended as a Processional
Hymn, and it is still so used on Good Friday, when the
Blessed Sacrament is carried from the Repository to the
High Altar. Neale justly styles the Vexilla Reyis “a
world-famous hymn'' and “one of the grandest in the
treasury of the Latin Church'' (Medieval Hymns p. 6).
It was composed by Fortunatus on the occasion of the re-
ception of a relic of the True Oross, which was sent by the
Emperor Justin ΙΙ to St. Radegunde. Read Monsignor
Henry’s interesting article on this hymn in the Gath.

man’s redemption. Qua, sc. cruce. Vita.- the author of
life, Christ. Vitam (cateruam).
