AUTHOR: Probably by Rabanus Maurus (776-856).
METER: Iambic dimeter, TRANSLATION by Father Aylward‚
O.P. There are about sixty translations, eight of Which

to the Holy spirit. With the exception of the Te Deum,

Maurus, Charlemagne‚ 81. Ambrose, and to St. Gregory
the Great. Read the articles on the Verri Creator Spiritus,
