Blood of Christ, what is done to the species cannot there-
fore be said to be done to the Body and Blood of Christ
itself. If, for instance, the former are divided or broken,
the Body of Christ is not thereby divided or broken. But
as the Body of Christ exists permanently under the species,
and is really present wherever the species are, it is actually

Father according to His Divinity3 less than the Father
according to His humanity. Who, although He is both God
and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ. One, not by the
conversion of the Godhead into fiesh, but by the assuming
