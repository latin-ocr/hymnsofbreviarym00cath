Plagasque Jesu Filii flows;
F ac rite nos revolvere. Pondering sweetly‚ one by one,

Jesu’s Wounds and Mary’s woes.

Deiparae tot lacrimae, Enough to drown a world of sin;

Quibus lavare sufficis Tears that Jesu's sorrows fed,

Totius orbis crimina. Peace and pardon well may win!

Amara contemplatio, For our prayers and praises prove;

Sint et dolores Virginis And Our Lady's woes become

AEterna cunctis gaudia. Endless joys in heaven above.

Qui passus es pro servulis, All on Thee our love we pour;
