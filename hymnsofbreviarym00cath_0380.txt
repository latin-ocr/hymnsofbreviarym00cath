TRANSLATORS OF THE HYMNS

AYLWARD, VERY BEV. JAMES AMBROSE, O.P.
(1813-1872) was the Dominican Prior at Woodchester,
England. His translations were edited by Mr. Orby
Shipley, in whose Annus Sanctus many of them appear.
“Father Aylward,'' says Mr. Shipley, “was a cultured and
talented priest of varied powers ancl gifts, whose memory
is held dear by all who knew and were influenced by him.’'
Hymns: 67, 68, 87.

BAGSHAWE, MOST BEV. EDWARD GILPIN (1829-
1915). Educated at St. Mary’s College Oscott, and at Lon-
don University. Bishop of Nottingham (1874), titular
Archbishop of Seleucia (1904). Translated all the hymns
of the Breviary and Missa] in his Breviary Hymns and
Missal Sequences (Burns‚ Oates and Washbourne‚ London,
1900). His translations are the latest as well as the most
literal of all the translations of our Latin hymns. His sole
aim was “to keep to the sense of the original, neither add—
ing to this nor taking from it'' (Preface). His translations
are too labored and prosy‚ but it is unfair to judge them
without considering the purpose of their pious author.
Hymns: 98, 146.

BALL, REV. THOMAS ISAAC, LL.D. (1838-1916).
Dr. Ball contributed numerous translations of Latin hymns
to many hymnals, notable among which are the Appendioe
to the Hymnal Noted, 1863, and The New Office Hymn Book,
1905. His translations are faithful, musical, and sustained.
Hymns: 81, 90, 135.

BENEDICTINES OF STANBROOK, Worcester, Eng-
land. The translations ascribed to The Benedictines of
Stanbrook are taken from their classic little volume ,The
Day Hours of the Charch, which contains the Breviary
Office in Latin and English for all the Hours except

Matins. (Burns, Oates and Washbourne, London, 1916.)
Hymns: 99, 100, 121, 122, 140.
