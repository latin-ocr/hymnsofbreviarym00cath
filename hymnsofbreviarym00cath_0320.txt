AM morte victor obruta NOW Christ, the Conqueror of
Ab inferis Christus redit, death,
F rectisque culpae vinculis, Breaks sin's enslaving chain,
Coeli recludit limina. And rising from the tomb returns,

And opens heaven again.

Moestis alumnis impluit. In fiery tongues of love.

‘Soluta carnis pondere The Virgin, freed of mortal
Ad astra Virgo tollitur, weight‚

Excepta eoeli jubilo, Is borne than stars yet higher,
Et Angelorum canticis. And with glad melody is hailed

By each Angelic choir.
