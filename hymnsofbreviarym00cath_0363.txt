DEDICATION OF A CHURCH

thirty translations. LITURGIOAL Usa: Hymn for Vespers
and Matins. First line of Original Text: Urbs Jerusalem
beata, or Urbs beata Jerusalem. The hymn was greatly
altered by the revisers under Pope Urban VIII, in 1632.
The Original Text, as found in the Benedictine and Do-
minican Breviaries, with J. M. Neale's much admired
translation of the same is given below. It is interesting to
compare the two texts. It will be noticed that the rugged
beauty of the Original Text, in trochaic tetrameter, is re-
placed in the Roman Breviary Text by smooth polished
iambics. With reference to the revision, Neale thinks that
the grand old hymn “lost half its beauty in the process'’
(Medieval Hymns, p. 18). This hymn is based on the fol-
lowing passages of the New Testament: I Peter 2, 5; Apoc.
213 Eph. 2, 19-223 Heb. 12, 22.

1. “Jerusalem, heavenly city, blessed vision of peace,
who, built of living stones, art raised aloft to the stars,
and like a bride art encircled by countless thousands of
Angels.'’ “The heavenly city, J erusalem'’ is the Church
Triumphant, the Blessed. In Hebrew, the word Jerusalem
means “vision of peace.'’ The “living stones'’ are the
souls of men.

2. “O bride dowered with a fortunate dowry, with the
glory of the Father‚ and with the grace of the bridegroom
shed over thee; O queen all-beauteous united to Christ the
King, Ο resplendent city of heavenl’' Sorte, lot, marriage
portion, dowry. The bride is the Church Triumphant, and
the bridegroom is Christ, who is the glory of the Father
(Heb. 1, 3).

3. “Thy gates here glitter with pearls and stand open
to all; each mortal who follows virtue is drawn thither; each
one who, impelled by the love of Christ, endures torments.''
Ostia patent, cf. Apoc. 21, 21-25. Tormenta is not re-
stricted to Martyrs only, but refers to anyone who en-
dures trials and tribulations (Acts 14, 21).

4. “Polished by vigorous blows of the chisel and by
countless strokes of the Master's mallet, these stones raise
up this mighty structure, and, bound together with appro-
priate joints, they are placed alost in the highest summit.'’
