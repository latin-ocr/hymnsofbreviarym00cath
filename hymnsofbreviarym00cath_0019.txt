PREFACE

phrase, must compare stanza with stanza, must evaluate
sensitively the appropriateness of an English metre to that
of the Latin original. Meanwhile, he must remain always
fearful lest some subtle essence or quintessence of the Latin
poet’s fine frenzy may have been lost, some hardly dis-
cernible antithesis in thought or phrase overlooked (as
Dr. N eale pointed out in several English translations of the
Angelic Doctor's Panye Linyua), some curiosa felicitas of
the Latin handled with unlaboriously heavy touch. The art
of selection in the midst of many fairly satisfactory rendi-
tions is indeed, to the conscientious anthologist, a. most try-
ing one. But the artistic labor does not end here. Merely
to select at random will hardly suffice. But to choose the
version always which seems best to satisfy the canons of
art might result in the too frequent recurrence of the same
names—those of Caswall, Neale‚ Newman, for instance-
with an undesirable monotony. A large volume must have
a large variety in authorship, when it is an anthology in
the field of Latin hymnody. The difficulty confronted is not
the superficial one, however, of a mere variety in names.
In the domain of music, one may tire of the majesty of
Bach, the stormy emotionalism of Beethoven, the “cloying
sweetness'' of Mendelssohn. In literature, one may desire
a change even from the morning freshness of Chaucer‚ the
vivid heart-searchings of Shakespeare, the sententious
rhythms of Pope. More is needed than a mere variety in
metric forms—a device used by translators in order to
avoid monotony. There should be variety in mental and
spiritual experience and outlook, in poetic gifts, in rhymic
and rhythmic facilities, in variant literary modes. To sum
it up briefly‚ there should be variety in the unmeasurable
thing called personality. For the style is the man—the
complex, like himself, of his culture, his loves and hopes,
his anxieties and fears. Accordingly, the compiler has
availed himself of the labors of some sixty translators of
the one hundred and seventy-three hymns included in his
volume. The reader may therefore confidently look for
that variety which is the spice of literature as of life. In-
cidentally, he will receive a broad vision of the hymnologic
work going on in the world around him.
