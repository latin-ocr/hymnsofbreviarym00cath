THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY

7. “To God the Father be prame, to Chris-t most high
be glory, and to the Holy spirit, to the Three be one
honor.'' Unus, equal, the same.

149Β Ave Maris Stella

AIL, Sea-star we name thee,
Ever-Maid acclaim thee,

God His Mother‚ Portal
To the life immortal.

Ave was the token

By the Angel spoken:
Peace on earth it telleth‚
Eva’s name re-spelleth.

F ree the worldly-minded
Luminate the blinded.
Every ill repressing,
Win us every blessing.

Plead‚ and play the Mother!
He will, and none other,
Born for our salvadon,

Hear thy supplication.

Maiden meek and lowly,
Singularly holy,

Loose the sins that chain us3
Sanctify, sustain us.

Help us live in pumuess,
Smooth our way with sureness,
Till we also eye Thee,

Jesu, ever nigh Thee.

Faffler, Son, we bless Thee,
Likewise do confess Thee‚
Holy spirit, TrinaL

Onely, first and final.

150 Quem terra, pontus, sidera
UEM terra, pontus, sidera HE God whom earth, and sea,
Colunt, adorant, praedicant and sky

Adore, and laud, and magfflfy,
