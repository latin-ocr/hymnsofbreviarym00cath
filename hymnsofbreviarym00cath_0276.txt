Vitae senatum laureati possident.

Principum

Es consecrata glorioso sanguine:

Horum cruore purpurata ceteras

Excellis orbis una pulchritudines.

Honor, potestas, atque jubilatio,
In unitate, quae gubernat omnia,
Per universa saeculorum saecula.

Decora lux

THE beauteous light of God’s
eternal Majesty
Streams down in golden rays to
grace this holy day
Which crowned the princes of the
Apostles’ glorious choir,

And unto guilty mortals showed
the heavenward way.

The teacher of the world and
keeper of heaven’s gate,

Rome’s founders twain and rulers
too of every land,

Triumphant over death by sword
and shameful cross,

With laurel crowned are gathered
to the eternal band,

Ο happy Rome! who in thy martyr
princes’ blood,

A twofold stream, art washed and
doubly sanctified.

All earthly beauty thou alone out-
shinest far,

Empurpled by their outpoured
life-blood’s glorious tide.

All honor& power, and everlasting
