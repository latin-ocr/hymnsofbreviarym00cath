AUTHORS OF THE HYMNS

to Peter the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny (1122-1156).
There is a fine analysis of this great poem in the article on
Bernard of Cluny, in the Cath. Encycl. Hymns: 170, 171,
ELPIS (d. about 493) was the wife of the philosopher
Boethius (480-524). Elpis was the aunt of St. Placidus,
the well-known disciple of St. Benedict. Recent researches,
however, have led to the conclusion that there is no reason,
or at least insufficient reason, to ascribe the authorship of
Aurea luce (Decora ἱππ) to Elpis. None of the ancient
MSS. attribute it to her (James Mearns in the Dict. os
Hymnoloyy, p. 1632). Hymns: 90, 91, 116, 117.
FORTUNATUS, VENANTIUS (530-609) was a native
of the district of Treviso in Upper Italy and was educated
at Ravenna, where he devoted himself to the study of
oratory and poetry. He was miraculously cured of a
disease of the eyes through the intercession of St. Martin
of Tours. It was while on a visit to the tomb of this Saint
that he made the acquaintance of Queen Radegunde at
Poitiers. It was here that he was ordained priest, and
later consecrated Bishop of Poitiers, where he remained
until his death. Fortunatus represents “the last expiring
cffort of the Latin muse in GauP' to retain something of
the “old classical culture amid the advancing tide of bar-
barism’' (Diot. of Hymnol„ p. 383). Hymns: 51, 52, 53,
GREGORY THE GREAT, ST. (540-604). This illustri-
ous Pope and Doctor of the Church was born at Rome,
where he founded the Benedictine monastery of St.
Andrew, of which he himself became Abbot. Much against
his own will he was elected Pope to succeed Pelagius II, in
590. The Benedictine editors of St. Gregory's works
ascribe to him eight hymns. Daniel assigns him three
others. In the light of the latest researches it must be
admitted that Pope Gregory’s place in hymnody cannot as
yet be definitely fixed. Hymns: 6, 7, 10, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 48, 49, 126.
HERMANN OONTRACTUS (1013-1058) was born at
Altshausen in Suabia. He was a cripple from birth and
could not move without assistance—hence the surname
