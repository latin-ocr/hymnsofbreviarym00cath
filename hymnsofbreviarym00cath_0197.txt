CORPUS CHRISTI

canst do all things, who here seedest us mortals‚ make us
there be Thy guests, the co-heirs‚ and companions of the

heavenly citizens. ' '

Terra viventium: Credo videre bona

Domini in terra viventium (ΡΞ. 26, 13).

76 Pange Lingua

PANGE lingua gloriosi

Corporis mysterium,
Sanguinisque pretiosi,
Quem in mundi pretium
Fructus ventris generosi
Rex effudit Gentium.

2Nobis datus, nobis natus
Ex intacta Virgine,
Et in mundo conversatus,
Sparso verbi semine,
Sui moras incolatus
Miro clausit ordine.

3In supremae nocte coenae‚
Recumbens cum fratribus
Observata lege plene
Cibis in legalibus,
Cibum turbae duodenae
Se dat suis manibus.

*Verbum caro, panem verum
Verbo carnem efficit:

Fitque sanguis Christi merum,

Et si sensus deficit,
Ad firmandum cor sincerum

Sola fides sufficit.

¹⁵Tantum ergo Sacramentum
Veneremur cernui:
Et antiquum documentum
Novo cedat ritui:
Praestet fides supplementum
Sensuum defectui.

1NG, my tongue, the Saviour's
Of Hingl' (1)ζέΙῖ the mystery sing3
Of the Blood, all price exceeding‚
Shed by our immortal King,
Destined, for the world’s redemp-
From atliiloble womb to spring.

Of a pure and spotless Virgin

Born for us on earth below,

He, as Man, with man conversing,

Staycd, the seeds of truth to
sow;

Then He closed in solemn order

Wondrously His life of woe-

On the night of that Last Supper
Seated with His chosen band,
Hc, the Paschal victim eating,
First fulfills the Law’s command:
Then as F ood to all His brethren
Gives Himself with His own hand.

Word made F lesh‚ the bread of
nature

By His word to F lesh He turns;

Wine into His Blood He changes:

What though sense no change
discerns?

Only be the heart in earnest,

Faith her lesson quickly learns.

Down in adoration falling,

Lo! the sacred Host we hail;

Lo! o’er ancient forms departing,
Newer rites of grace prevail;

F aith for all defects supplying,
Where the feeble senses fail.
