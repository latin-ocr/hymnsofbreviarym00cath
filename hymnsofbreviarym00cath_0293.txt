SS. CYRIL AND METHODIUS

Aornons and TRANSLATORS as in the preceding hymn.
There are three translations. METER: Iambic dimeter.
Hymn for Lauds on the Feast of SS. Cyril and Methodius.

1. “O beauteous light of your fatherland, and light be-
nignly disposed towards the Slavonic nations, brothers, all
hail! we will praise you in our yearly song of praise.'’
Amica, adj„ friendly.

2. “Whom Rome applauding receives as a mother em-
bracing her sons, she honors them with the miter of
bishops and endows them with new strength.'' Supply eos
in the last two lines of this stanza.

3. “Ye proceed to barbarous lands to bring them Christ:
as many as vain error had deceived, ye fill with the blessed
light of faith.''

4. “A heavenly zeal takes possession of hearts freed
from sin3 the horrid sight of thorns is now changed into
flowers of holiness.’' The last two lines are to be under-
stood in a figurative sense. After the fall of man, God
oursed the earth, and it was to bring forth thorns and
thistles (Gen. 3, 18). This was all changed by the Re-
demption, and the earth watered by the Blood of Christ
would bring forth “fiowers of sanctity'' where hitherto
only thorns abounded. This is beautifully expressed in the
second stanza of Hymn 119.

5. “And now, O ye who are established in the serene
abode of the Blessed, hear our suppliant prayer: preserve
for God the Slavio nations.''

6. “May the one fold of Christ unite those now sunk
in error; may their faith, emulous of the deeds of their.

· forefathers‚ bloom with even greater beauty.'' AEmula,

adj„ emulating, rivaling3 constr. with the dative.

7. “Thou‚ Ο Blessed Trinity quicken us with heavenly
love, and grant that the sons may follow in the illustrious
footsteps of their Fathers.''
