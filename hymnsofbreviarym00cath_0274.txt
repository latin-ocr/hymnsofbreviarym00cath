O NIMIS felix, meritique celsi,

Nesciens labem nivei pu-
doris,
Praepotens Martyr, nemorumque
cultor,
Maxime Vatum.

²Serta ter denis alios coronant
Aucta crementis, duplicata quos-
dam3
Trina te fructu cumulata centum
Nexibus ornant.

³Nunc potens nostri meritis opi-
mis
Pectoris duros lapides revelle,
Asperum planans iter, et reflexos
Dirige calles.

4Ut pius mundi Sator et Redemp-
tor
Mentibus’ culpae sine labe puris,
Rite dignetur veniens beatos
Ponere gressus.

⁵Laudibus cives celebrent superni
Te Deus simplex, pariterque
trine,
Supplices et nos veniam pre-
camur:
Parce redemptis.

O nimis felix

MORE than blessed, merit
high attaining,
Pure as the snow-drift, innocent
of evil,
Child of the desert, mightiest of
Martyrs,
Greatest of Prophets.

Thirtyfold increase some with
glory crowneth;
Sixtyfold fruitage prize for others
winneth3
Hundredfold measure, thrice re·
peated, decks thee,
Blest one, for guerdon.

O may the virtue of thine inter-
cessmn,

All stony hardness from our
hearts expelling,

Smooth the rough places, and the
crooked straighten
Here in the desert.

Thus may our gracious Maker and
Redeemer,

Seeking a station for His hallowed
footsteps‚

F ind, when He cometh, temples
undefiled‚

Meet to receive Him.

Now as the· Angels celebrate Τὴγ

Godhealiraldgssential, Trinity co-

Spare 'Plissail-ddeemed ones, as they
bow before Thee,

Pardon imploring.

This is a continuation of the two preceding· hymns.
