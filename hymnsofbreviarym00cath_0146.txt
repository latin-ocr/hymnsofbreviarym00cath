PROPER OF THE SEASON

arias had long foretold these same playoe in the sacred
members of Our Lord: Quid sunt plagae istae in medio
manuum tuarum? Et dicet: His plagatus sum in domo
eorum qui diligebant me (Zaoh. 13, 6). The following is
D. F. MacCarthy’s rendering of this stanza:

Blessed Mother of predicfion,
Stamp the marks of crucifixion
Deeply on my stony beart,
Ever leading where thy bleeding
Son is pleading for my needing,
Let me in His wounds take part.

7. “Grant that I may devoutly weep with thee, and suf-
fer with the Crucified as long as Ι 611311 live. Ι long to stand
beside the Cross with thee, and to unite myself to thee, in
thy grief.''

8. “O peerless Virgin of virgins, be not unfavorably dis-
posed towards me now3 grant that Ι 111357 mourn with thee.
Grant that Ι 111357 bear about (in my body) the death of
Christ3 make me a sharer in His passion, and make me
mindful of His sufferings.'' Amarus, bitter; unkind, ill-
disposed. Fortem mortem Christi.- A reference to ΙΙ Cor.
4, 10. Fac (mc) consortem.

9. Η0113111 that Ι 111357 be wounded with His wounds, that
I may be inebriated With the Cross and with the Blood of
thy Son. That Ι 111357 not be tormented by the flames of
hell, may Ι, Ο virgin, be defended by thee on the day of
Judgment.'’ Succensus, from succendo 3, set on fire; used
here pleonastically. Inebriari: As in Ps. 35, 9: Inebriabun-
tur ab ubertate domus tuae: et torrente voluptatis tuae
potabis eos. Translation: “They shall be inebriated (i.e.,
plentifully filled, sated‚ filled to overflowing) with the
plenty of thy house3 and thou shalt make them drink of the
torrent of thy pleasure.'' See also Ps. 22, 5.

10. “When‚ Ο Christ, the hour has come for me to depart
hence, grant that through Thy Mother I may obtain the
palm of victory. When my body shall die, grant that the
glory of Paradise be given to my soul.''
