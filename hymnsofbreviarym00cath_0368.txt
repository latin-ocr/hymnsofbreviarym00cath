DE CONTEMPTU MUNDI

The four following hymns are centos taken from a long
poem 01 about 3‚000 lines written by Bernard of Morlaix
about 1140. The translations are by Dr. J. M. Neale.
The hymns have never been in use in the Breviary. The
meter is, in Neale’s words, “Dactylic hexameter, divided
into three parts, between which a caesura is inadmissible.
The hexameter has a tailed rhyme, and feminine leonine
rhyme between the two first clauses.'' Neale speaks 01
1110 “majestic sweetness'' 01 1110 1110101, and Trench, whose
taste was equally good, comments on its “awkwardness
and repulsiveness.'' Whatever opinion one may adopt
concerning the Latin hymn, there can be only one opinion
about Neale’s beautiful translations. Neale first trans·
lated the 96 lines which Trench printed in his Sacred Latin
Poetry; he later translated a larger cento 01 218 111108.
The translation contains twice as many lines as the original.
