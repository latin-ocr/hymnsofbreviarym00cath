CORPUS CHRISTI

(Is. 9, 6). Sparso verbi semine: Our Lord is the sower in
the beautiful “Parable of the Sower'' (Matt. 133 Mark 4;
Luke 8); the seed is the good tidings of the kingdom of
God, which Christ came on earth to sow in the hearts of
men. Miro clausit ordine; What this “wondrous manner’'
was is explained in the next two stanzas.

3. “On the night of the Last Supper, reclining with His
brethren--the Law having been fully complied with in re-
gard to legal meats—with His own hands, He gives Him-
self as Food to the assembled twelve.'' Turbae duodence,
to the assembly twelve in number. For duodenae, 333 denus
in 1113 Glossary. Cibis iu Zeyalz'bus (cf. Exod. 12, 3-11).

4. “The Word-made-Flesh changes by His word true
bread into His Flesh; and wine becomes the Blood of
Christ3 and if the intellect does not grasp this, saith alone
suffices 10 make sure the sincere heart.⁷' This stanza, on ·
account of the many verbal and real antitheses it contains,
has been “the great crux of the translator'' (Neale). In
the article on the Panye Liwyua in the cath. Encycl. there
are seven translations of this stanza and much interesting
comment. Verbum caro.- the Incarnate Word, the God-
Man, the Word-made-Flesh (cf. John 1, 1-14).

5. “Let us therefore, prostrate, adore so great a Sacra-
ment, and let the Old Law give way to the New Ordinance3
let saith supplement the weakness of the senses.'' Et
antiquum . . . . ritui: and let the Old Law (with its
typic sacrifices and Paschal Lamb) give way to the New
Rite (in which the Lamb of God is sacrificed). Cernu-i,
adj„ prostrate, profoundly bowed; with deep humility.

6. “To the Father and to the Son be praise, glory, salva-
tion, honor, power, and benediction also! and to Him pro-
ceeding from Them both be equal praise.’'

Et ex praecordiis sonent prae- And from the inmost breast
conia3 Let songs of praise resound;

Let ancient rites depart,
