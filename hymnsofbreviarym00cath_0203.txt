'CORPUS CHRISTI

See the “Preliminary Observations'' above. METER:
Iambic dimeter. TRANsLA'rION by J. M. Neale3 the last two
stanzas by Father Caswall. There are about twenty-five
translations, four of which are in the Annus Sanctus.
LITURGICAL Usu: Hymn for Lauds on the Feast of Corpus
Christi. The O Salutaris is familiar from its frequent use
in Benediction. In this beautiful hymn St. Thomas imitates
the hymn Verbum Superuum, No. 36. The fourth stanza
is an admirable example of perfect form and condensed
meaning. It so pleased Rousseau that he would have given
all his poetry to be its author.

1. “The Heavenly Word going forth, yet not leaving
the right hand of His Father, went forth to His allotted
work, and arrived at the evening of His life.” Verbum:
the Word, the Eternal Son of the Father (cf. John 1, 1-14).
Dexteram: the place of honor and dignity3 by the incarna-
tion Christ did not relinquish this. Opus.- Christ said: Me
oportet operari opera. ejus qui misit me, etc. (John 9, 4).

2. “WVhen about to be delivered over to His enemies, by
a disciple, to be put to death, He first gave Himself to His

twofold species, that He might wholly feed man, who is of
a twofold nature.'' The Holy Eucharist is primarily the
food of the soul; but on account of the intimate union of
the body and soul, what promotes the health and vigor of
the soul, by a sort of redundancy augments the powers of
the body. The Holy Eucharist is av figure of that bread
which Elias ate, “and walked in the strength of that food
forty days and forty nights⁷' (cf. III Kings 19, 6-8).

4. “By being born, He gave Himself to us as our com-
panion3 at the table, He gave Himself as our food3 dying
He gave Himself as our ransom3 now reigning in glory
He gives Himself as our reward.'’ Se nascens, by His
incarnation. Couvesceus (convescor), while eating with
His apostles at the Last Supper, He gave, etc. Se moriens,
when dying on the Cross, He gave, etc.

5. “O Saving Victim, that openest the gate of heaven;
hostile attacks oppress us, give us strength, bring us a.id.''
Hostia, victim, host, sacrifice. According to St. Paul,
