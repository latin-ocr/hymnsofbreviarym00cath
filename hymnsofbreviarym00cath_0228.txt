number of hymn-books and other books that contain this
translation it is quite probable that a few million copies of
it are printed each year. It is said that the sale of H ymns
Ancient and Modern (H. A. ὦ M.) alone exceeds one mil-
lion copies annually. Dr. Irons' translation is in our own
Baltimore Manual of Prayers, and in the London Catholic
Truth Society’s Book of Sequanae& The translation re-
tains the exact meter and rhyme scheme of the original.

87D

DAY of wrath and doom impending,
David’s word with Sibyl’s blendmg!
Heaven and earth in ashes ending!

Ο, what sear man’s bosom rendeth‚
When from heaven the Judge descendeth‚
On whose sentence all dependeth!

Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth‚
Through earth’s sepulchers it ringeth‚
All before the throne it bringeth.

Death is struck, and nature quaking,
All creation is awaking,
To its Judge an answer making.

Lo! the book exaetly worded,
Wherein all hath been recorded3

Thence shall judgment be awarded.

When the Judge His seat attaineth,
And each hidden deed arraigneffl,

Nothing unavenged remaineth.

What shall I, frail man, be pleading?
Who for me be interceding,
When the Just are mercy needing?

King of majesty tremendous‚
Who dost free salvation send uS‚
Fount of pity‚ then befriend us!

Think, kind Jesu! my salvation
Caused Thy wondrous Incarnation;
Leave me not to reprobation.
