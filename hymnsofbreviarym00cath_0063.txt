Patrique compar Unice, With Christ, Thy sole-begotten Son,

Regnans per omne saeculum. Reigning and blest forevermore.

Ammon: St. Ambrose (340-397). METER: Iambio dimeter.
Translation by J. M. N eale. There are seventeen transla-
tions.

1. “Our limbs having been refreshed with sleep‚ spurn-
ing our bed, we risez O Father, we beseeoh Thee, that Thou
be near us, who sing Thy praises.'’ Spreto cubili, abl. ab·
solute.

2. “Let our tongue first praise Thee, may the ardor of
our soul seek after Thee, that Thou, Ο Holy One, mayest be
the souree of the actions that follow—throughout the day.’'
Exordium, beginning, source, eto. A good morning of-
fering will make God the beginning or source of all our
daily actions.

3. “Let darkness give way to light, and night to the day-
star, that sin, which darkness brought in, may depart with
the gift (advent) of light.'' Light is a symbol of Christ3
night and darkness are symbols of sin and of the powers of
darkness. Christ is the True Light (John 1, 9) at whose
rising or advent, spiritual darkness wanes.

4. “We also suppliantly pray that Thou remove all hurt-
ful things, and that Thou, out of the mouths of those prais-
ing Thee‚ mayest be forever praised.'' Iidem: “Idem‚ the
same, is often used where the English requires an adverb
or adverbial phrase (also, too, yet, at the same time).''——-
