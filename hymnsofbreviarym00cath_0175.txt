WHITSUNTIDE

JAM Christus astra ascenderat,

Reversus unde venerat,
Patris fruendum munere
Sanctum daturus Spiritum.

2Solemnis urgebat dies,
Quo mystico septemplici
Orbis volutus septies,
Signat beata tempora.

³Cum lucis hora tertia
Repente mundus intonat,
Apostolis orantibus
Deum venire nuntiat.

*De Patris ergo lumine
Decorus ignis almus est,
Qui fida Christi pectora
Calore Verbi compleat„

⁵Impleta gaudent viscera,
Afflata sancto Spiritu,
vocesque diversas sonant,
F antur Dei magnalia.

⁶Notique cunctis Gentibus,
Graecis, Latinis, Barbaris,
Simulque demirantibus,
Linguis loquuntur omnium.

Jam Christus astra ascenderat

There came a rushing mighty

To fill with fervor of His word.

The spirits faithful to their Lord.

With joy the Apostles’ breasts are

By Godfi{{{‚Holy Ghost inspired:

And straight, in divers kinds of

The Νοειξέξὲιῗέ works of God they
preach.

To rnen of every race they speak,

Alike Barbarian, Roman, Greek:

From tlfle same lips, with awe and
