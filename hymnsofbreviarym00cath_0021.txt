ΗΕ purpose of this volume is to provide an in-
troductory work on the hymns 01 the Roman
Breviary and Missal. In its pages will be
found all the hymns in the Breviary since the

Bull Divino Afflatu of Pope Pius X (1911), to-
gether with the five sequences of the Missal‚ and a few
other hymns. There is at present in English no work that
even approximately covers this ground. Many thoughtful
men have long felt that something should be done to make
our liturgical hymns better known and better understood.

The Dies Irae, the Vexilla Reyis‚ the Stabat Mater, the
Lauda Sion, and the Panye Lingua are of incomparably
greater value to the Christian than the greatest of pagan
odes. However, the study of the ancient classics and of
Christian hymns may and should go hand in hand. Each
has its own purpose; there is no quarrel between them. The
one serves to cultivate a delicate and refined taste, the
other enkindles in the soul the lostiest sentiments 01 relig-
ion. The study of the former prepares one for a fuller
and more generous enjoyment of the latter.

The present volume is intended as a manual for begin-
ners—for those who have had no access to the many excel-
lent works on Latin hymns edited in other languages. The
editor has no new theories of authorship to propound, no
new historical facts to announce, and in general no new
interpretation of disputed passages in the hymns. For
historical data he freely acknowledges his indebtedness to
many existing works, especially to the Dictionary of H ymn-
oloyy so ably edited by the late Rev. Dr. John Julian, and
the Rev. J ames Mearns‚ M.A.
