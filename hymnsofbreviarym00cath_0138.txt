The Panae linqua) is in use in both the Missal and the
Breviary. Missal use: The whole hymn (eleven stanzas)
is recited or sung during the “Adoration of the Oross'’ in
the morning service on Good Friday. Breviary use: For
Offiee use, the hymn is divided into two equal parts with a
common doxology. The first five stanzas are assigned to
Matins from Passion Sunday to the Wednesday of Holy

for the Feasts of the Finding (May 3) and of the Exalta-

stanzas, beginning with Lustra sex, are used in Lauds
whenever the Pawye linqua is used in Matins. Read the

in his Thes. Hymnol. lists fourteen hymns beginning with
the words Panye linqua. Lauream, vietory3 the Original
Text has proelium, which to the revisers under Urban VIII
seemed tautological. N eale, however, maintains that
proelium is the better word, for—“It is not to the glory of
