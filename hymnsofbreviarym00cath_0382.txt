TRANSLATORS OF THE HYMNS

Breviary and other sources have a wider circulation in
modern hymnals than those of any other translator, Dr.
Ν eale alone exeepted. This is owing to his general faith-
fulness to the originals, and to the purity of his rhythm’'
(Diot. of H wamel). Many of Father Caswall's translations
appear in the Annus Sanctus and are characterized by Mr.
Shipley as “vigorous, dogmatio hymns.'' Father Caswall
translated the Roman Breviary Text. Despite his un-
doubted ability as a translator, one ean not but regret that
so many of his translations are in Common Meter instead
of Long Meter. Hymns: 22, 31, 32, 37, 42B, 43, 47, 54, 73,
74, 76, 78, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 93, 106, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112,
117, 119, 124, 125, 126, 127, 132, 134, 137, 147, 148, 152, 153,

1866. “His translations of Latin hymns are close, clear,
and poetiea13 they have much strength and earnestness,
and the rhythm is easy and musical . . . Greater use,
however, might be made of these translations than has been
done. Their earnestness and dignity would raise the tone

28, 161.
