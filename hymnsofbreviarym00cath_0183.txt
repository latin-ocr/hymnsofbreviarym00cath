CORPUS CHRISTI

Although this hymn is not found in the Breviary or
Missal it is deservedly very popular. There is an article
on O Deus 690 amo te in the Cam. Eucycl. The article
treats of two Latin hymns beginning with the same first
line3 both hymns are attributed to St. Francis Xavier. Of
these hymns Dr. Duffield says: “They are transfused and
81101 through by a. personal sense of absorption into the
divine love, which has fused and crystallized them in its
fiercest heat.'' And 10 their author, he pays 11118 beautiful
tribute: “It 18 impossible to study his life without 3 8011-
viction there was in it 3 devout and gallant purpose to bless
the world . . . . And 111 1118 two 1157111118 which bear his
name we are able to discover that fine attar which 18 1118
precious residuum of many crushed and fragrant aspira-
tions, which grew above the 11101118 of sharp trial and were
strewn at last upon the wind-swept beach of that poor
Pisgah island from which he truly beheld the distant Land”
(Latin H yma-Writers aad Their H ymas, pp. 298-315). The
hymn offers no difficulty to the translator.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS

The next five hymns 318 1118 81831 Ε118113118118 1157111118 of
St. Thomas Aquinas (1227-1274). They were written at
the request of Pope Urban IV, on the occasion of the insti-
tution of the Feast of Corpus Christi in 1264. The hymns
of the Angelic Doctor are remarkable for their smoothness
and clearness, and for their logical conciseness and dog-
1113118 precision. They are pervaded throughout by a spirit
of the profoundest piety so characteristic of the Angel of
the Schools. It is fitting that 3. 81831 Doctor of the Church
and a great Saint should have confined his hymn-writing to
a single subject, and that, the sweetest and profoundest of
all subjects‚ the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.

The hymns taken collectively contain an admirable sum-
mary of the Catholic doctrine of the Holy Eucharist. “The
Lauda Sion,’' says Archbishop Bagshawe‚ is in itself “a
condensed compendium of exact theology'' (Breviary
