PROPER OF SAINTS

Matius. This hymn is a cento from the twelfth and last
poem in the Cathemerinon of Prudentius. The complete
poem consists of 208 lines, and has furnished four centos
for Breviary use: viz„ Ο sola rmagnarum urbium (Ephi-
phany), Audit tyrannus anxius, and salvete flores
martyrum. Read the article on Quicumque Christum
quaeritis, and the two articles on Transfiyuration, in the
Cath. Encycl.

1. “All ye who seek Christ, lift up your eyes on high;
there it will be permitted you to behold a token of His
eterna] glory.'’ The Transfiguration of Our Lord is de-
scribed in Matt. 17, 1-9; Mark 9, 1-83 Luke 9, 28-36. On
Mount Thabor Our Lord granted Peter, J ames, and John a
sign, or foretaste, of eterna] glory. The Apostles were over-

. whelmed and rendered beside themselves by only a partial

manifestation of the majesty of Christ's glorified Body.

2. “A brilliant Something we perceive that can know no
end, sublime, exalted, interminable, older than heaven and
chaos.'' By chaos is meant the confused, disordered‚
primitive mass out of which the universe was made.

3. “This is the King of the Gentiles, and the King of
the Jewish people‚ who was promised to our father
Abraham, and to his seed forever.'' Christ was styled
King of the Jews by the Magi (Of. Matt. 2, 2). Abraham
was the first Patriarch and the founder of the Hebrew race
(Of. Gen. 17, 1-9; Luke 1, 55).

4. “In the presence of the prophets who had also an-
nounced Him, the Testator and Father commands us to hear
and believe Him.'’ The Prophets Moses and Elias ap-
peared at the Transfiguration and conversed with Our
Lord. The testimony of the Father is found in Matt. 17, 5.
Tcstator: The Father is styled “testator'' in reference to
Ps. 2, 8: Postula a me, et dabo tibi gentes haereditatem
tuam, et possessionem tuam terminos terrae.

5. ⁴ ‘Together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, Ο
J esus, eternal glory be to Thee, who dost reveal Thyself to
the little ones'' (Cf. Matt. 11, 25; Luke 10, 21).
