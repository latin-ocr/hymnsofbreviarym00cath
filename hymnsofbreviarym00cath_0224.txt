PROPER OF THE SEASON

4. “Death and Nature shall stand aghast‚ when the
creature shall rise again to answer to the Judge.''

Death shall shrink and Nature quake
When all creaturos shall awake,

Answer to their God to make.
—Dean Alford

Et dedit mare mortuos qui in eo erant: et mors et infernus
dederunt mortuos suos qui in ipsis erant3 et judicatum est
de singulis secundum opera ipsorum (Apoc. 20, 13).

5. “The written Book shall be brought forth, in which
all is contained whence the world is to be judged.''

Then the volume shall be spread
And the writing shall be read
Which shall judge the quick and dead.

—Isaac W illiams

Liber: Et vidi mortuos magnos et pusillos stantes in con-
spectu throni, et libri aperti sunt; et alius liber apertus est,
qui est vitae3 et judicati sunt mortui ex his quae scripta
erant in libris secundum opera ipsorum (Apoc. 20, 12).
The “Book’' is the Book of Life which contains a most de-
tailed record of each one’s life, even of his most secret
thoughts and idle words.

6. “When therefore the Judge shall be seated, whatso-
ever is hidden shall be brought to light; nothing shall re·
main unpunished.''

When the Judge His place has ta’en
All things hid shall be made plain,

Nothing unavenged remain.

-Α bp. Trench

With this stanza the epic or narrative part of the hymn
closes, the remaining stanzas are lyric in character.

7. “What shall I, wretched, then say? What patron
shall I entreat, when even the just shall hardly be without
anxiety‘W

What shall wretched 1 then plead,

Who for me shall intercede,

When the righteous scarce is freed?
—Isaac Williams
