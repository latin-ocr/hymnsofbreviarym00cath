PROPER OF SAINTS

4. “Still resting in the concealed abode of the womb,
thou diclst perceive thy King reposing in His chamber:
thereupon both parents by the merite of their son revealed
hidden things.'’ The last two lines of this sta-nza are
obscure. In the translation given above the two parents
are Zachary and Elisabeth3 and the mysteries they uttered
are Elisabeth's “Blessed art thou among W01nen,'’ etc.
(Luke 1, 42-45), and Zachary's “Blessed be the Lord. God
of Israel‚'' etc. (Luke 68-79). However, there is no lack of
translators who ignore the masculine uterquc and the
singular nati and translate quite as literally as Archbishop
Bagshawe:

“The two Mothers then, on account of their Babes,
Things hidden unfold.”

In this interpretation the two parents are Mary and
Elisabeth, and the whole stanza gives us a picture of the
Visitation. The “hidden things'’ uttered by Elisabeth are
the same as those mentioned above (Luke 1, 42-45), and
Our Lady replies in her incomparable Magnificat (Luke 1,
46-55). This is the better interpretation.

5. “Glory be to the Father, and to· the only-begotten
Son, and to Thee‚ Ο spirit, power eternally equal to Them
both, one God, forever and ever.’'
