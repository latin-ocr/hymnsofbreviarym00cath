Et nos reples dulcedine. And shed Thy sweetness here.

Carnis negatum sensibus. To fleshly sense denied.

Largire per praesentiam. Within Thy chosen place.

Qui te revelas parvulis, The Father ever blest,
Cum Patre et almo Spiritu, The Holy Spirst, One and Three,
In sempiterna saecula. Be endless praise addrest.
