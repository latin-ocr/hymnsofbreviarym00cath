Smitten by ‘the tyrant foe
On life’s threshold,-—as the

Strews ξὶῗὲθτοεεε ere they ‘blow.

F irst to bleed for Christ, sweet

What a simple death ye died!
Sporting with your wreaths and

With the Father‚ and the spirit,

While eternal ages run.

43 J esu dulcis memoria

ESU dulcis memoria,

Dans vera cordis gaudia:
Sed super mel, et omnia,
Ejus dulcis praesentia.

2Nil canitur suavius,
Nil auditur jucundius,
Nil cogitatur dulcius,
Quam Jesus Dei Filius.

‘¹ Jesu spes poenitentibus,
Quam pius es petentibus!
Quam bonus te quaerentibus!
Sed quid invenientibus?

‘Nec lingua valet dicere,
Nec littera exprimere:
Expertus potest credere,
Quid sit Jesum diligere.

⁵Sis Jesu nostrum gaudium,
Qui es futurus praemium:
Sit nostra in te gloria,
Per cuncta semper saecula.

ESU, the very thought of Thee

With sweetness fills my hreast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

Nor voice can sing, nor heart cen
frame,

Nor can the memory find,

A sweeter sound than Thy blest
Name,

O Saviour of mankind!

Ο Hope of every contrite heart,

Ο Joy of all the meek,

To those who fall, how kind
Thou art!

How good to those who seek!

But what ‘to those who find? Ah!
Nor torigilse nor pen can show:
The love of J esus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.

Jesu, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
Jesu, be Thou our glory now,
And through eternity.
