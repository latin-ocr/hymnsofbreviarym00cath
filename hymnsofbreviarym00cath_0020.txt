PREFACE

The utility of Father Britt's labor of love is praetioal
in many ways. A good translation is really an interpreta-
tion. It does not render merely the words or even the
thoughts of the original writer into another tongue, but
seeks as well to pieroe into his mood, to reproduee 11 for
the reader, to catch and fix that first passion which

beggars all behind,
Heirs of a tamer transport prepossessed.

And so it is that the learned Latinist may still learn at
times something from the studious, gifted, visioned trans-
lator, even as the learned Shakespearian etymologist may
gain deeper insight from the aetion and emphasis of a Gar-
riek or a Booth. In the lower levels of thought, a good in·
terpretation may be gained from a good translation3 for not
a few of the Latin hymns need intelligent oommentary for
their easy or complete elucidation-——a commentary some-
times supplied, in a large sense, by a poetic translator. On
a still lower plane, some of the Latin hymns (such as the
AEterne Rerum Corndz'tor, the Ut Quea‘nt Laxis) present
grammatieal tangles not readily solvable by the ordinary
graduate of a course in Latin language and literature. But
if the innumerable hosts of those who have had no training
in Latin are to benefit by the wisdom, the piety, the fervor
enshrined in the hymns of the Roman liturgy, the work of
the translator becomes indispensable.

It remains but to felicitate the compiler upon the 00111-
pletion of hjs long and loving labor and to bespeak for his
volume the attention of all students of Latin hymnology
and all lovers of the venerable hymns of the Roman Missal
and Breviary.
