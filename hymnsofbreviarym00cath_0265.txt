ST. VENANTIUS

⁴Verso deorsum vertice Then downwards hung, his mouth
Haurire fumum cogitur: exposed
Costas utrimque et viscera To clouds of smoke beneath
Succensa lampas ustulat. disposed‚
Whilst with slow torches, burning
clear,
His naked hreasts and sides they
sear.
²5Sit laus Patri, sit Filio, Praise to the F ather, and the Son,
Tibique sancte Spiritus: And Holy spirit, Three in One;
Da per preces Venantii Oh! grant that through this
Beata nobis gaudia. Martyr's prayer,
Your blissful joy we all may
share.

TRANSLATION by Father Potter. There =are four transla-
tions. LITURGIGAL Usn: Hymn for Vespers. St. Venantius
was martyred at the age of fifteen, in the year 250.

1. “Venantius‚ the Martyr of God, the light and glory
of the people of Camarum, having triumphed over torturer
and judge, now joyfully blends his voice With the song of
triumph.'’ Camertium, gen. pl. Camertes, duan, the in-
habitants of Camerino, Which was known in ancient times
as Camers. Abp. Bagshawe renders this line: “Who
Latium light and glory brings.'' As a matter of fact
Camerino is not in Latium but in Umbria some ninety
miles northeast of Rome. Father Caswall's translation in
his Lyra Catholica is scarcely less happy: “Camertium's
light, her joy and prize.''

2. “A child in years, after chains and imprisonment and
stripes‚ he is given as food to lions raging from long
hunger.'’

3. “But the ferocity of the lions spares his innocence,
and unmindful of their rage and hunger they lick the
Martyr’s feet.''

4. “With head hung downward he is forced to inhale
smoke, and a flaming torch scorches his ribs and his flesh
on either side.'’ Viscera is used to signify the flesh lying
under the skin.

5. “Be praise to the Father‚ and the Son, and to Thee‚
