1. “O Thou Only-Begotten of the sovereign Father‚ look
upon us With a benign eountenanoe, Thou who eallest to the
pinnaole of glory the penitent heart of Magdalene.''

2. “The lost groat is again restored to the royal
treasury3 and the gem wiped clean from mire surpasses the
stars in brillianoe.’' For the Parable of the Lost Coin see
Luke 15, 8-9. The drachma was a. small eoin bearing the
image of the reigning king. It here represents the human
soul on which is impressed the image and likeness of God.
The “gem'’ referred to is the human soul purified by
penanoe and so adorned with sanctifying grace that it out-
shines the sta-rs in splendor.

3. “O Jesus, balm of our wounds‚ and sole hope of the
penitent‚ mayest Thou, through the tears of Magdalene‚
wash away our sins.''

4. “O most gracious Mother of God, eonvey us weeping
descendants of Eve, from a thousand waves of life to a
haven of safety.’' Fluctibus, storms, afflietions.

5. “To God alone be glory for His manifold graces,—
to God who forgiveth the sins of sinners and bestoweth
rewards.'’
