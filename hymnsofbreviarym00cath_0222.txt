PROPER OF THE SEASON

There is a very interesting article on the Dies Irce, in the
cath. Encycl. A scholarly and extensive series of articles
on the Dies I rae appeared in The Dolphin, from N ov., 1904,
to May, 1905. The series, 144 pages in all, consists of N otes
on the Dies Irae by the Rev. Mr. Warren, M.A.‚ a collabora-
tor in Julian's Dictionary of H ymnoloyy, and of Comments
on the N otes of M r. Warren, by the Rt. Rev. Msgr. H. T.
Henry, Litt.D. To these articles the editor is greatly in-
debted. In the article on Judyment, in the Carth. Encycl„
read the last section, which treats of the General Judg-
ment.

The following is Sir Walter Scott’s greatly admired con-
densed rendering of the Dies I ναὶ which is found in his Lay
of the Last Minstrel. It consists of only twelve lines.

ΤΗΑΤ Day of wrath, that dreadful day,

When heaven and earth shall pass away,
What power shall be the sinner’s stay?
How shall he meet that dreadful day?

When, shrivelling like a parc-hed scroll,
The flaming heavens together roll;

When louder yet, and yet more dread,
Swells the high trump that wakes the dead:

Ο, on that day, that wrathful day,

When man to judgment wakes from clay,
Be Thou the trembling sinner's stay,
Though heaven and earth shall pass away!

The metrical translations of the respective stanzas, given
below, are from various authors whose translations are
mentioned by Mr. Warren as among the best.

The stanzas are uniformly in trochaic sevens, thus form-
ing a fine cento.

1. “That day of wrath, that day shall reduce the world
to glowing embers‚ David with the Sibyl being witness.'’
