PROPER OF SAINTS

²Egregie Doctor Paule, mores
instrue,

Et nostra tecum pectora in
coelum trahe:

Velata dum meridiem cernat
fides,

Et solis instar sola regnet
caritas.

³Sit Trinitati sempiterna gloria,
Honor, potestas, atque jubilatio,
In unitate, quae gubernat omnia,
Per universa aeternitatis saecula.

Lead us, great teacher Paul, in
wisdom’s ways,

And lift our hearts with thine to
heaven’s high throne;

Till saith beholds the clear
meridian blaze3

And sunlike in the soul reigns
charity alone.

Praise, messing, majesty‚ through
endless days,

Be to the Trinity immortal given;

Who in pure unity profoundly

Etemafiyaffike all things in earth
and heaven.

This is a continuation of the preceding hymn. TRANSLA-
TION by Father Caswell. LITURGICAL Usa: Hymn for
Lauds on the Feast of SS. Peter and Paul. See Hymns 90

anii- “3⁴10 blessed shepherd Peter, thou to whom was given

the power to open heaven, and, opened, to close it, merci-
fully receive the prayers of thy suppliants, and by thy
word unloose the chains of their sins.'' Precantum for
precantium. This stanza is a metrieal rendering of Matt.
16, 19: Et tibi dabo claves regni coelorum. Et quodcumque
ligaveris super terram, erit ligatum et in coelis: et quod·
cumque solveris super terram, erit solutum et in eoelis.

2. “Illustrious teaoher Paul, mould thou our lives, and
draw with thee to heaven our hearts‚ till saith now veiled
beholds the bright noonday, and, like the sun, eharity alone
doth reign.” St. Paul was taken up “even to the third
heaven‚'' i.e.‚ to the abode of the Angels and Saints (Cf.
II Gor. 12, 1-4). The same illustrious Doetor teaehes us
that—“We see now through a glass in a dark manner''
(i.e., by faith): “but then face to faee'' (I Cor. 13, 12).
And again, that charity remains forever-——“never falleth
away'' (I Cor. 13, 8) though in the next world saith shall
pass into vision, and hope into the enjoyment of God.
