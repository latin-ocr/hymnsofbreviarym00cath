TRINITY SUNDAY

² Da dexteram surgentibus, Assist us while our minds we mise,

Exurgat ut mens sobria, Inflamed with Thy immortal

Flagrans et in laudem Dei praise3

Grates rependat debitas. That with our sober thoughts, we
may

Forever our thanksgiving pay.

Natoque Patris unico, Eternal praise Thy works reveal,
Cum Spiritu paraclite, And sing with the celestial host
In sempiterna saecula. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
