PROPER OF THE SEASON

translatableness of the hymn may be obtained from the
judicious opinions of eminent critics. Thus Mr. Saints-
bury: “Rhyme, alliteration, cadence, and adjustment of
vowel and consonant values, all these things receive per-
fect expression in it, or, at least in the first thirteen stan-
zas, for the last four are a little inferior. It is quite aston-
ishing to reflect upon the careful art or felicitous accident
of such a line as

Tuba mirum spargens sonum,

with the thud of the trochee falling in each instant on a
different vowe13 and still more on the continuous sequence
of five stanzas, from Judex eryo to mm sit cassus in which
a word could not be displaced or replaced by another with-
out loss. The climax of verbal harmony corresponding to
and expressing religious passion and religious awe, is
reached in the last,

Quaerens me sedisti lassus,
Redemisti crucem passus:
Tantus labor non sit cassus!—

where the sudden change from the dominent e sound (ex-
cept in the rhyme foot) of the first two lines to the a's of the
last is simply miraculous, and miraculously assisted by what
may be called the internal sub-rhyme of sedisti and
redemisti. This latter effect can rarely be attempted with-
out a jingle: there is no jingle here, only an ineffable
melody. After the Dies Iroe, no poet could say that any ef-
fect of poetry was, as far as sound goes, unattainable3
though few could have hoped to equal it, and perhaps no
one except Dante and Shakespeare has fully done so’r'
(Flourishiny of Romanoa, p. 9).

According to Dr. Duffield‚ the Dies Iroe “gives us a new
conception of the powers of the Latin tongue. Its wonder-
ful wedding of sense and sound—the u assonance in the
second stanza, the ο assonance in the third, the a and i
assonance in the fourth, for instance—the sense of organ
music that runs through the hymn, even unaccompanied,
as distinctly as through the opening verses of Lowell's
Vision of Sir Launfal and the transitions as clearly marked
in sound as in meaning from lofty adoration to pathetic
