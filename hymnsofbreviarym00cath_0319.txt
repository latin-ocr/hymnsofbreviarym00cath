THE HOLY ROSARY

2Α proditore traditus

Raptatur in poenas Deus,
Durisque vinctus nexibus
Flagris eruentis caeditur.

⁸1ntexta acutis sentibus,
Corona contumeliae,
Squallenti amictum purpura,
Regem coronat gloriae.

⁴Molis crucem ter arduae,
Sudans, anhelans concidens,
Ad montis usque verticem
Gestare vi compellitur.

⁵Confixus atro stipite
Inter scelestos innocens,
Orando pro tortoribus,
Exsanguis efflat spiritum.

“Gloria tibi, Domine,
Qui natus es de Virgine,
Cum Patre et Sancto Spiritu
In sempiterna saecula.

And ngw the traitor’s work is
The clanffilzns crowds around Him
Bound Stlorggillan God the Son

Quivers beneath the blood-red
scourge.

Lo! clad in purple soiled and

Meeklywffigusaviour waiteth now

While wretches plait the cruel

To οῐοὲιῐῗῃνινίῐὴ shame His royal
row.

Sweating and sighing, faint with

Of whzlzft'Sliath flowed from life’s
red fount,

He bears the exceeding heavy

Up toCrtffis verge of Calvary’s
mount,

Nailed to the wood of ancient
curse,

BetweenO two thieves the Sinless

Still pralylrling for His murderers,

Breathes {lorth' His soul, and all
is one.

Glory to Thee, and honor meet,
Jesu, of Maiden-Mother born,
And Father and the Paraclete,
Through endless ages of the morn!
