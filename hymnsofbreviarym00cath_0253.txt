THE SEVEN HOLY FOUNDERS

(1892). LITURGICAL UsE: Hymn for Matius. With the ex-
ception of the hymn M atris sub almae numine, the five
hymns formerly in use on the Feast of the Seven Founders
have been omitted from the latest editions of the Breviary.
The five hymns were translated by Archbishop Bagshawe
and Father Wallace‚ O.S.B. Julian's Dietionary of Hym-
noloyy mentions no translations of the hymns in honor of
the Seven Holy Founders. Read the article on Servites,
Order of, in the Carth. Eneyol.

1. “While wars were raging and blood-stained cities
groaned with fratricida] carnage, the Virgin appeared
ever manifesting the new gifts of a mother.'' Bella.- The
bloody feuds and dissensions among the Italian citios from
the llth to the 13th century are familiar to the student of
history. St. Alexis, the last of the Seven Founders, died
in 1310.

2. “Behold, in her grief, she calls unto herself seven
faithful servants that they might recall to mind the suffer—
ings which J esus endured, and which she, the sharer of His
sufferings‚ endured beneath the Cross of her Son.'' The
object of the Servite Order is to preach everywhere com-
passion for the sufferings of J esus crucified and of Mary
desolate, as well as hatrecl for sin, the accursed cause of
them both (cf. Servite M annal, p. xiv).

3. “Without hesitation they obey their Lady's call:
spurning their stately palaces and wealth, they with-
draw afar from the city into the hidden recesses of Mount
Senario.'’ The Blessed Virgin first appeared to the Seven
Holy Founders in 1233. She exhorted them to leave the
world and dedicate themselves, under her auspices, to the
service of God. This they did without delay.

4. “Here they afflict their bodies with dire punishments,
atoning for the sins of guilty men: here by their prayers
and by their abundant tears they avert the anger of God.’'

5. “The Mother greatly encourages them and tells them
that they should wear a garb indicative of mourning3 the
pious undertakings of the holy company prosper; won-
drous things become manifest.'' Mira, miracles.

6. “A young vine becoming green in winter proclaims
the glory of the Fathers: children unweaned proclaim them
