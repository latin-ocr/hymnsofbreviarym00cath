WHITSUNTIDE

an incomparable hymn, breathing of the sweetness of Para-
dise, and regaling us with heaven’s sweetest fragrance.
Only the soul buried in deep 1000110011οη can suspect and
taste the wealth of deep thought and affections this Pente-
cost hymn contains, and that, too, in a form remarkable as
much for beauty as for brevity’' (The Holy Saeriftce of the
Mass, p. 464). There is an article on the Veni Sancte
Spiritus, in the Cath. Eneycl.

In studying this hymn the richness of the rhyme is deserv-
ing of special note. In each of the six-line stanzas, lines 1
and 2, 3 and 6, 4 and 5 rhyme; and every third line through—
out the hymn ends in ium.

The introductory and thrice repeated Veni in the first
stanza is expressive of the intense longing of a world-
buffeted, sin-harried soul for the advent of the “best con-
soler.’' The similar repetition of the verb Da in the closing
stanza is equally expressive of earnestness and of loving
confidence in the “ giver of gifts.'’
