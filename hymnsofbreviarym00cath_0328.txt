Feast ot' St. John Cautius.

1. “Thou didst subdue thy body with fasts, and with
bloody blows didst lacerate it, that as an innocent soldier
thou mightest follow the army of penitents.’'

2. “Let us also follow diligently in the footsteps of the
good father: let us follow, that the spirit may restrain
the licentiousness of the flesh.''

3. “During the cold winter thou offerest to the poor the
kindly provided garment, and with food and drink thou
dost alleviate the thirst and hunger of the needy.'’ St.
John not only gave away his food and clothing, but on one
occasion at least he even gave away his shoes and walked
home barefooted (Matius, Lectio V).

4. “O thou who didst refuse assistance to no one asking
for it, ’the Polish nation and strangers beseech thee that
thou protect thy native kingdom.''
