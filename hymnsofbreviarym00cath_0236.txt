Cives Romulei, plaudite gloriae:
Insignem meritis dicite Virginem,

M artinae celebri

WITH joyous ο songs, great

Rome, Martma’s fame ex·

Her gldaeing praises tell, and all
her mighty deeds;

A Virgin pure and chaste, she

leads a stainless life,
And for her Lord a Martyr bleeds.

A happy home is hers, and all
that makes this world

So sweet, and fresh, and fair, to
those who love its wiles:

From noblest parents sprung, ’ mid
wealth, and love, and joy,

Her life speeds on, ’mid naught
but smiles.

These pleasures soon she spurns—
her wealth she gladly gives
To Christ’s own blessed poor-
herself, to God above;
No other wealth she seeks save
her own spotless sponse,
Forever blest in His pure love.

O Thou, the Martyrs’ strength, all
cheating joys expel,

And fill us with Thy bright and
never-fading love;

Show us the bearn divine, which
forms the crowning joy,

God, Three in One, of bliss above.
