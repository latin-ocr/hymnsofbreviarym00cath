AUTHOR'S PREFACE

15. F. J. Mone: Lateiazische Hymnen des Mittelalters, 3
Vols, Freiburg, 1853-1855. Since its publication this has
been one of the standard works on Latin hymns.

16. Η. A. Daniel: Thesaurus Hymnoloyicus, 5 Vols„
Leipzig, 1841-1856. A valuable and extensive collection of
hymns. The arrangement however is poor, and the abbre—
viations and references in the notes are most obscure. The
first volume contains in parallel columns about fifty Brev-
iary hymns in both the Origiual Text and the Roman
Breviary Text.

17. Dreves and Blume: Analecta Hymnica Medii AEvi.
Leipzig, 1886. This great work when completed will con-
tain about sixty volumes. More than fifty are now in print.
It is the most extensive work on Latin hymnody thus far
undertaken. The work listed next below should be in the
hands of every user of the Analecta H ymnica.

18. James Mearns: Early Latin Hymnaries. An index
of hymns in hymnaries before 1100. It gives references to
the three following works where the texts of the hymns are
printed: Analecta Hymsnica (supra) ; Werner's Die
altesten Hymnensammlwnyen von Rheiozau, 1891; Steven-
son's The Latin Hymns of the Aaylo-Saoeon Charch„ 1851;
References are also given to Ohevalier’s Repertorimn
Hynvnoloyicum, the great index to Latin hymns.
