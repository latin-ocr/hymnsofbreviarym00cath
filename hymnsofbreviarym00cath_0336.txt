Ever-Virgin‚ happy Gate of HeavenP' The name Mary is
derived from the Hebrew “Miriam,⁷' which signifies “Star
of the Sea''; in Chaldaie it means “Lady.'' Caeli porta.-
By her powerful intercession with her Divine Son she
opens for sinners the gates of heaven. Ave: Ave gratia
plena: Dominus tecum3 benedicta tu in mulieribus (Luke
1, 28). Read the first of the two articles on Annwnciation‚
in the Cath. Encycl. Cf. also Luke 1, 26-38.

2. “Reeeiving that Ave from the mouth of Gabriel, es-
tablish us in peace, reversing the name of Eva.’' Heva
z Eva, which “reversed'’ gives Ave.

3. “Break the chains of sinners, give light to the blind,
drive away evils, ask for all that's good.” Vincla for
vincula. Caecis, to those who are spiritually blind, who
have eyes and see not (cf. Ps. 134, 16).
