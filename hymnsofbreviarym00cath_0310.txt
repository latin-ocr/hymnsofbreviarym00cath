PROPER OF SAINTS

Tibi Christe splendor Patris. In this and in the following
hymn the Ohurch sings the praises not only of St. Michael
but of all the holy Angels. Read the article on Michael the
Archanyel, in the Cath. Encycl. At the end of the article
there is an account given of Michaelmas Day. There are
separate articles on each of the Angels mentioned in the
following hymn (No. 135).

In the revision of 1632, this hymn, according to the Dict.
of Hymnoloyy was “recast greatly for the worse.'' The
Original Text with J. M. Neale's translation is given below.

1. “Thee, Ο splendor and power of the Father, Thee, O
Jesus‚ the life of our hearts, we praise in the presence of
the Angels who hang upon the words of Thy mouth.''
Pendent, to regard with close attention.

2. “It is for Thee this dense host of countless thousands
of princes engage in battle: but it is the victorious Michael‚
the standard-bearer of salvation, who unfurls the standard
of the Oross.'' Corona, a crown, also an assembly. Mille
is sometimes used in the sense of countless‚ innumerable,
infinite. As to the number of Angels‚ Cf. Matt. 26, 53;
Apoc. 5, 11. For the “great battle in heaven‚'’ Of. Apoc.
12, 7-9.

3. “He casts the direful head of the dragon into the
depths of hell, and hurls headlong from the heavenly citadel
the prince together with his rebels.’' Hic, Michael. Of
Satan’s fall Our Lord said: Videbam satanam sicut fulgur
de coelo cadentem (Luke 10, 18).

4. “Let us follow this leader against the prince of pride,

that a crown of glory may be given to us from the throne
of the Lamb.''
