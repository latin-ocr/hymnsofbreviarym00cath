Stillat cruoris guttulas!

Clavi retusa cuspide

Pedes manusque perforant.

⁶Postquam sed ille tradidit
Amans volensque spiritum,

Geminusque liquor exilit.

⁷Ut plena sit redemptio
Sub torculari stringitur,
Suique Jesus immemor,
Sibi nil reservat Sanguinis.

In hoc salutis balneo

Qui se lavat, mundabitur.

⁹ Summi ad Parentis dexteram
Sedenti habenda est gratia,
Qui nos redemit Sanguine,
Sanctoque firmat Spiritu.
