TRANSLATION by Father Caswall. There are six transla-
tions. LITURGIOAL Usnz Matius hymn for the Feast of the
Sacred Heart,

1. “Behold‚ how the. haughty and savage horde of our
sins hath wounded the innocent Heart of God, who de-
serveth not such treatment.'' M eremis, of God not deserv-
ing, etc.

2. “Our sins guide the lance of the hesitating soldier,
and mortal sin doth sharpen the iron of the cruel shaft.’'
Vibrantis militis; The soldier is represented as hesitating‚
uncertain of the exact place where he should insert the
spear to pierce the Saviour’s Heart: our sins guided the
spear. Cuspidis: cuspis, a point, esp. the head of a spear.

3. “From that pierced Heart was born the Church united
With Christ: that entrance was made in the side of the Ark
for the salvation of the human race.'’ Genti ad salutem,
for the human race, for their deliveranoe.

4. “From It unfailing grace flows forth like a sevenfold
flood‚ that therein‚ in the Blood of the Lamb, we may wash
our sullied robes.’' In Baptism we are presented with a
stola candida, a snow·white garment, which is symbolical
of the sanctifying grace which adorns the 80111. By sin
this stola cwndida becomes a stola sordida. Et laverunt
stolas 81138, et dealbaverunt eas in sanguine Agni (Apoc.
7, 14: see also 22, 14). Septiformis fluvius, the seven
sacraments.

5. “It were shameful to turn again to sins, which lacer-
ate that blessed Heart3 but let us in our hearts emulate the
flames, which are types of love.''

6. “Grant us this, O Christ, this, O Father‚ this, O Holy
spirit, to whom be power and glory and. kingdom forever.''
