ALTO ex Olympi vertice
Summi Parentis Filius,
Ceu monte desectus lapis
Terras in imas decidens,
Domus supernae, et infimae,
Utrumque junxit angulum.

²Sed illa sedes coelitum
Semper resultat laudibus,
Deumque Trinum et Unicum
Jugi canore praedicat:

Illi canentes jungimur
Almae Sionis aemuli.

³Haec templa, Rex coelestium,

Imple benigno lumine:
Huc o rogatus adveni,
Plebisque vota suscipe,
Et nostra corda jugiter
Perfunde coeli gratia.

⁴Hic impetrent fidelium
Voces precesque supplicum
Domus beatae munera,

F ather's Son,
Descending like that mystic stone
Cut from a mountain without

hands,
Came down below, and filled all

Unitingl,m1¹1iliscl⁹way in the sky,
His house on earth, and house on

high.

That house on high‚-—-it ever rings

With praises of the King of kings;

F orever there, on harps divine, .

They hymn th’ eternal One and
Trine;

We, here below, the strain
prolong,

And faintly echo Sion's song.

Ο Lord of lords invisible!

With Thy pure light this temple
Hither,fidi't= as invoked, descend;
Here to Thy people’s prayer

Here, tlitrtgiigli all beans, forever-
Thy Srfliffissgs quick'ning graces
pour.

Here may the faithful, day by day,
Their hearts’ adoring homage pay;
And heligoereceive from Thy dear
