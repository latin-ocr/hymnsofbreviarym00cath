AUTHOR: Ascribed to Pope st. Gregory the Great (540-
604). METER: lambio dimeter. TRANSLATION by Cardinal
Newman. There are thirteen translations. There is an
article on this hymn in the Cath. Enoycl.

1. “Look down, O sovereign Creator of the world, and
our Ruler, and deliver uS, overwhelmed by sleep, from a
sinful rest.'' The time of rest, by affording occasions of sin
and temptation‚ may become harmful or sinful.

2. “Thee‚ all-holy Christ, we implore that Thou forgive
all our sins: to praise Thee, we rise and interrupt the linger-
ing hours of the night. '' M oras, variously rendered—houm,
rest, etc.; lit.‚ a delay, a space of time.

3. “By night we lift up our hands and hearts, as the
Prophet commands us to do, and as Paul, by his deeds‚ sanc-
tioned.'' St. Paul put into practice the precept of the
Prophet. The Prophet is David, the Royal Psalmist, who
says: In noctibus extollite manus vestras in sancta, et
benedicite Dominum (Ps. 133, 2). Paulus: A reference to
St. Paul in the Acts of the Apostles: Media autem nocte,
Paulus et Silas orantes laudabant Deum (Acts 16, 25).

The following is Father Caswell’s translation of this
stanza:

Wh0‚ as the holy Psalmist bids,

Our hands thus early raise;
And in the morning sing with Paul
And Silas hymns of praise.

4. “Thou seest the evil that we have done; we lay bare

our secret faults3 sighing we pour forth our prayers; pat-
don what we have done amiss.”
