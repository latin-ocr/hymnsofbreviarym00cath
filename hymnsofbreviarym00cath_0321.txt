THE HOLY ROSARY

“Bis sena cingunt sidera Our Mother's gentle brow now
Almae parentis verticem: shines

Throno propinqua Filii With crown in starry sheen‚
Cunctis creatis imperat. As nigh her Son, in light en·

throned‚
She reigns creation’s Queen.

‘Gloria tibi, Domine, O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
Qui natus es de Virgine, All glory he to Thee‚
Cum Patre et Sancto Spiritu With F ather and with paraclete,
In sempiterna saecula. Through all eternity.
