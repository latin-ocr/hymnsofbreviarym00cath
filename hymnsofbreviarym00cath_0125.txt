THE EPIPHANY

Magi were expressive of their belief in Christ's royal gen—
eration, in His divine nature, and in His human nature.
Gold, the noblest of the metals‚ hence a gift suitable for a
king, was symbolical of His royal generation: frankin-
cense is a symbol of prayer, and was therefore, an ac-
knowledgment of His Divinity3 and myrrh, which is used
in embalming, was expressive of His mortality as man.

3. “The Heavenly Lamb touched the cleansing bath of
the limpid waters: by washing us, He took away (sustulit)
sins which He Himself had not committed (detulit).” Ecce
agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccatum mundi (John 1, 29).
“It is the teaching of St. Thomas that the Baptism of
Christ was the occasion when He gave to Christian Baptism
its power of conferring grace3 but that the necessity of
this Sacrament was not intimated to men till after the
Resurrection'' (Father Hunter’s Outlines of Doymatz‘c
Theoloyy, Vol. II, p. 532).

4. “A new manifestation of power: the water of the J'ars
becomes red, and the water which was bidden to issue forth
as wine, changed its nature.” Hydriae is the subject, and
aquae the genitive of contents. Constr.: Et unda (quae)
Jussa (est) vinum fundere, mutavit originem. The follow—
ing is the Catholic poet Crashaw’s beautiful epigram on the
miracle at Cana:

Lympha pudica Deum vidit et erubuit.

The modest water saw its God and blushed.
