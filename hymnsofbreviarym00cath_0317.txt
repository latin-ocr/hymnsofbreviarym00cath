Vespers hymn. Thence: The Five J oyful Mysteries——one
stanza being devoted to each Mystery. The Breviary Of-
fice in honor of the Most Holy Rosary, with its four proper
hymns, was approved by Pope Leo XIII, in 1888. In
studying the hymns it will be observed that the first three
hymns celebrate in their fifteen stanzas, the fifteen

capitulation of the subJ‘eet matter of the first three hymns.

The hymns were written in 1757.
