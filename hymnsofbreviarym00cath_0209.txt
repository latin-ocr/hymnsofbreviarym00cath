TRANSLATION by Father Husenbeth. There are eight trans-
lations. LITURGIOAL Usn: Hymn for Vespers. Of the five
hymns given here in honor of the Saered Heart, the Annus

abound, too, in Biblieal allusione, every stanza recalling
some type, or figure, or prophecy, or fulfilment'' (Msgr.
Henry, in his Eucharistiae, p. 235).

all things (John 1, 1-3).
